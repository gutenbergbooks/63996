<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>I believe that those of long ago who wrote books
frequently began with an apology to the gentle reader,
and I am inclined to do likewise, or at least to rise and
explain.</p>

<p class='c004'>The fact is, this narrative was originally undertaken
merely as a family reminiscence, but Mr. C. C. Hine’s
life was so interwoven with the later life of Woodside
that what was intended as a brief sketch to illustrate
a series of photographs has gradually grown into a
book covering the story of the region now known as
Woodside as completely as I have been able to gather
it. This will account for the somewhat personal view
frequently indulged in and for some of the minor details.</p>

<p class='c004'>Woodside, until it was opened as a residence section,
was a purely farming region whose inhabitants
went elsewhere for their groceries and religion, and
as the average farmer thinks more of making hay than
history, the movement must necessarily be somewhat
slow.</p>

<p class='c004'>Dr. Macauley once said of Woodside: “As God
made it it was a beautiful place, but as the hand of
man left it I have nothing to say.” That the hand of
man has desecrated it all those who knew its woodlands
and waterways twenty-five or more years ago
can readily testify, but one of its good points even
man cannot reach, and that is its climate, for it is the
coolest part of Newark. This in former times was
unconsciously testified to by the drivers of the old
horse cars, who were in the habit of shedding their
coats upon arrival at the cemetery from the north,
there to hide them among the bushes, and again resume
them on the return trip to Second river.</p>

<p class='c004'>This region was then as beautiful a stretch of hill
and vale and riverside as could well be found. The
river was clear and sparkling, and fish abounded;
the call of the whip-poor-will was heard on the evening
air, and the brown thrush sang to us from the
thicket, while squirrel and hare were always with us.</p>

<p class='c004'>Groves of trees were numerous and beautiful.
“Bird’s Woods” along Second river with its magnificent
old pines and hemlocks, the outer edge of the
wood fringed with an undergrowth of laurel, while
partridge berries gleamed from the depths of the moss
underfoot, made an entrancing spot which has seldom
been equalled, and the ruins of the old mills along
the stream gave a picturesque touch that none who
grew up with the region can forget.</p>

<p class='c004'>Effort has been made to give credit for information
received; in some cases authority for statements made
is given in connection with the statements themselves,
as it is interesting and valuable to know the source,
but this is not always practicable, as the same item not
infrequently comes from several sources and it is occasionally
difficult to blend the varying opinions.</p>

<p class='c004'>In a few instances statements made by unknown
newspaper writers have been used. The stories are
given for what they are worth, but all of them are part
of the legend of the region and none have been invented
merely for filling.</p>

<p class='c004'>I have honestly done the best I could in gathering
and arranging the material. Now and then I have
come on a mine of information in such friends as Mrs.
Henry J. Winser and Messrs. E. A. Boyden, James S.
Taylor and James Swinnerton, but it has been mostly
here a little and there a little, and for such help I acknowledge
indebtedness to Mr. W. E. Blewett, Jr.,
Mr. E. A. Boyden, Miss J. F. Bradford, Mrs. R. H.
Brewster, Mr. Edward Burling, Mr. R. Smith Carter,

<p class='c004'>I am also indebted to the Newark Public Library,
the New Jersey Historical Society and the New York
Historical Society, and to the real estate records of
the Fidelity Trust Company.</p>

<p class='c004'>Through the courtesy and co-operation of Mr.
Charles Grant Schaeffer, Principal of the Elliott
Street School, the school children entered into a competition
for a cover design for this book which resulted
in the selection of the design submitted by Miss
Edna Eckert, a pupil in the Eighth B Grade.</p>

<p>Woodside in 1849. Enlarged from Sidney’s map of “Twelve Miles Around New York”, published in 1849.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
  <a id='Page_1'></a>
  <h3 class='c007'>GENERAL HISTORY.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Woodside was originally included in the
Newark grant, which extended north “to
the Third River above the towne, ye
River is called Yauntakah”. For a long time those of
this region in common with those of Belleville, were
known as the “Inhabitants of the Second River”.
But Newark on March 11, 1743, having become tired
of supporting the poor of so large a district, narrowed
its borders, drawing a line on the north just below
the eastern end of the Gully road to the “Boiling
Spring”.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE FIRST BOUNDARIES OF WOODSIDE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The description given in the Town Meeting of
March 11, 1743, reads as follows: “Beginning at Passaick
River, at the Gulley near the House of Doct’r
Pigot, thence North West (Northeast?) to Second
River, thence up the same to the Saw Mill belonging
to George Harrison, thence a direct Line to the North
East Corner of the Plantation of Stephen Morris,
thence to the Notch in the Mountain leaving William
Crane’s House to the Southward, thence on a direct
line to Stephen Van siles, thence Westwardly (Eastwardly?)
to Passaick River leaving said Van siles
Bars and Abraham Francisco’s to the Northward of
s’d Line: and it was agreed, that all on the Northward
<a id='Page_2'></a>of s’d Lines should be esteemed Inhabitants of
Second River, and all on the Southward of the Body
of Newark, excepting Levi Vincent, Johanes Kiper
and his Son Thomas Cadmus. John Low desired that
himself and his Father might be reconed or esteemed
Inhabitants of Second River, since they belonged to
that Society.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This is a verbatim copy taken from the “Newark
Town Records”, but I do not know just what it
means unless some previous copyist stood on his head
when putting down the points of the compass.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>AN INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY.</h4>
<p class='c006'>For nearly one hundred years this region was
a portion of Bloomfield, or Wardesson, as it was
formerly known, and when in 1839 Belleville was set
off from eastern Bloomfield, Woodside became a part
of the newer township, and so remained until March
24, 1869, when it became independent of all outside
control.</p>

<p class='c004'>At this time its boundaries extended from the mouth
of Second river along the west bank of the Passaic
to a point immediately below the Gully road, thence
west a little south to the Boiling Spring, cutting
across Second avenue above Mount Prospect avenue,
thence almost northeast to a point on the canal just
above what is now known as the “butter works”;
thence southeast a quarter mile or so to Second river
which it crossed and continued with Mill street as
its northern limit as far as the Back road, from
<a id='Page_3'></a>which point Second river was itself the dividing line
to its mouth at the Passaic.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>WOODSIDE SUBMERGED.</h4>
<p class='c006'>But, alas! on the fifth of April, 1871, our independence
was lost forever and most of us were turned
over to the tender mercies of the Newark politicians,
who have ever since exercised a wonderful ingenuity
in taxing us poor inhabitants to the limit and giving
as little in return as possible. In fact the only
thing we get for our taxes, aside from the fire department
service, is an occasional policeman, who comes
twice each year with tickets to sell for ball or excursion.
Does the road need paving or sewering, the
cost is assessed on the abutting property, and so is it
with sidewalks, and even with the shade trees which
the city fathers insist are good for us, and having
planted them they send us a bill therefor. The Woodsider
has never yet been able to ascertain what he is
taxed for, unless it is to keep the politicians in good
running order. This remark should be qualified to some
extent so far as the police are concerned, for no locality
could have a better protector than Mounted Officer
Niblo, who has long been on this post and who, we
hope, will long remain; there is also a patrolman who
does his duty as though his job depended on it, but
the majority of them seem to have the true politician’s
idea as to what is good for them.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sin was legalized by “An Act to divide the
township of Woodside between the City of Newark
and the township of Belleville”.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_4'></a>The boundary of Woodside is given as “beginning
at the intersection of the centre of the Second river
with the centre of the Passaic river; thence (1)
running southerly along the centre of the Passaic
river, the several courses thereof, to the northerly
line of the city of Newark (just below Gully road);
thence (2) westerly along the said line of the city of
Newark to the centre of the Great Boiling spring, at
the line of the township of Bloomfield; thence (3)
northerly along said line to the centre of Branch
brook; thence (4) northeasterly along the centre of
said brook, the several courses thereof, to the centre
of Second river; thence (5) down along the centre of
Second river, the several courses thereof, to the
centre of Passaic River, and the place of beginning.”</p>

<p class='c004'>All of the township of Woodside not included
within the above mentioned boundaries was annexed
to the township of Belleville.</p>

<p class='c004'>James S. Gamble, Horace H. Nichols and Charles
Akers, of the township of Woodside, were among
the commissioners appointed to see that the division
was properly carried out.</p>

<p class='c004'>The act was approved April 5, 1871.</p>

<p class='c004'>The transition from independence to slavery was
engineered, I am told, by three men for personal and
selfish motives, and it gives me great pleasure to record
that all three were sadly left. One longed to be
sheriff, but must live in Newark to secure the nomination,
and did not wish to remove from this pleasant
land; the two others were holders of considerable
<a id='Page_5'></a>property, and it was their hope that a boom in building
lots would set in that would materially fatten
their pocketbooks, and so in some dark and mysterious
way our model township was ceded to Newark.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the politician failed of election and the lots did
not sell, and “one of the disappointed real estate
owners, like Judas Iscariot, went out and hanged
himself”.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once the place belonged to Newark the street car
company could, of course, do what it liked with the
roadway, and it shortly proceeded to regrade (I had
almost said degrade) Washington avenue above Elwood,
utterly destroying the carefully laid out parkway
on which property owners had spent much
thought and money. Terraces and trees were ruthlessly
cut down and, to provide a dumping place for
the earth removed, Oraton street was cut through
and filled in with the Washington avenue debris.
“Ichabod was written upon the avenue and the fine
name of Oraton could in no way lend dignity to the
new street”, which at that time was largely given
over to negroes and laborers.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE OLD ROADS OF WOODSIDE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Until 1865 Woodside was a purely agricultural
district, except for the factories along Second river,
and contained but four roads of any moment. The
River road, the Back road to Belleville, the old
Bloomfield or Long Hill road and the lower road from
Belleville to Bloomfield, known as Murphy’s lane.
<a id='Page_6'></a>There was also one cross road known as Division
road or Bootleg lane, because of its shape; this is now
given over to Halleck street and Grafton avenue, with
that bit of Washington avenue which lies between.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>HOW WE ARE TO PROCEED.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The history and legend, dating before 1867, so far
as I have been able to find them, will be taken up
guidebook fashion by following each road in turn and
pointing out its wonders as we proceed.</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_7'></a>
  <h3 class='c009'>THE RIVER ROAD.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>“The road to ‘Hocquackanong’ was laid out from
the north end of Newark, as the path then ran,
through the village named, passing the north end of
the Acquackanonk meeting house and thence to
Pompton”. This was recorded March 16, 1707, and
must refer to the River road, though probably all the
laying out it received was on paper.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Indians from Paterson and beyond had a well
defined trail along the river bank which led to Newark
Bay, and the early settlers probably used this
without attempting much improvement.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE GULLY ROAD.</h4>
<p class='c006'>As we travel northward the River road naturally
begins with the Gully road. As far back as tradition
goes and the old maps show, the Gully road has existed,
but there is a theory that the Indian trail, of
which the River road is an expansion, continued
down the river bank, and one bit of folk-lore which
remains indicates that this may have been so.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>A GULLY ROAD GHOST.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The legend tells us that so long ago that those
who tell the story cannot compute the time, there
lived at the present junction of Washington avenue
<a id='Page_8'></a>and the Gully road an aged couple in a simple cot
that hardly kept them from the weather. There was
then a small stream that claimed the gully for its own,
but as time went on the brook gradually dried up, and
as gradually people from the back country began to
use its bed as a highway. As traffic grew the cottage
was found to lie in the way of travelers, and one night
it was ruthlessly torn down over the head of its defenseless
occupant, for by this time only one was left.</p>

<p class='c004'>The resultant exposure proved fatal, the old settler
being unable to survive the shock, and ever after
has his ghost walked the Gully road. The ghost has
not been seen for thirty years or more, but one who
has actually met the vision, a lady of years and education,
tells me that she distinctly saw it one dark Sunday
afternoon, about 1879, while on her way to
church.</p>

<p class='c004'>Though a resident here for several years she had
never heard of the Gully road ghost, nor did she
know that the region was haunted, but in the darkest
and loneliest part of the road she encountered a nebulous
shape about the size of a human being, standing
at a gate which gave entrance to one of the few places
along the road. My informant was young then, and
more easily frightened than now, but she saw too distinctly
to believe that she could have been mistaken.
It appears that the lady had disregarded the biblical
injunction to obey her husband, for he did not wish
her to go to church at that particular time, but she,
being contrary minded, insisted, and it seems highly
<a id='Page_9'></a>probable that the ghost was sent to warn her back into
path of obedience. Hurrying back she informed her
husband, but nothing more was seen of the apparition
and it was some time later that she learned that the
road was haunted and heard the above story from an
old settler.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>INDIAN RELICS FOUND IN THE GULLY ROAD.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The present level of the Gully road is much lower
than it was even fifty years ago, and there is a legend
that one hundred and fifty years ago a great freshet
cut out large quantities of earth here, but the higher
level could hardly have been of long duration, for Mrs.
Gibbs recalls that a number of years ago, while workmen
were digging a trench, possibly for the sewer,
they brought up what are thought to have been Indian
relics from a depth of twelve feet or more. Mr.
Gibbs’s brother was passing at the moment of discovery
and tried to purchase the find from the man in
charge, as he regarded it of considerable ethnological
value, but the contractor refused to sell, and when Mr.
Gibbs and his brother returned to the spot the men
had gone and their discovery with them, and to-day
<a id='Page_10'></a>the exact character of the find is not known. Other
Indian finds in this immediate neighborhood are a
stone mortar and pestle and many arrow points on
the Gibbs place. On the Sandford place, just above, a
stone mortar hollowed out of a heavy block long stood
by the well. This was kept filled with water for the
chickens to drink from. When the place was regraded
this stone disappeared, it having been probably
buried.</p>

<p class='c004'>(Since the above was put in type I have found one of the
laborers who was employed in building the sewer through the
Gully road. He tells me that this was about fourteen years ago,
that the find occurred just east of the entrance to the Gibbs place
on the north edge of the road, and consisted of four or five Indian
skeletons with many stone hammers, arrow points, etc. My informant
is under the impression that the burial place was extensive
and only partially uncovered.)</p>

<p class='c004'>From the fact that Indians would hardly dig to
any such depth as indicated above, it is fair to presume
that the filling in may have been comparatively
recent; possibly some great storm had washed masses
of earth down into the gully.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Gully road is now well paved and lighted and
much affected by that brazen highwayman the automobile,
but there was a time when it was a dark and
lonesome place where no honest man desired to be
caught after dark; where it is said smugglers filed by
during the silent watches of the night, the deserted
river bank here being a favorite rendezvous for those
whose deeds were evil.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>OLD MOLL DE GROW.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Sixty years or so ago a stone wall ran from the
bend of the Gully road, near the river diagonally to
Belleville avenue, across the property now occupied by
the cemetery. Beside this stone wall was buried the
first person interred on the site of the cemetery—a
noted witch, old Moll DeGrow, the fear of whose
<a id='Page_11'></a>shade lent greatly to the terrors of the Gully seventy-five
years ago.</p>

<p class='c004'>This witch was used by the elders as a bugaboo to
keep the children indoors after dark, and she appears
to have been eminently useful and successful in this
capacity. The Gully road was as black as a black
hat on a moonless night, and one who ventured abroad
at such a time never could tell when he or she might
be grabbed by the powers of darkness. During the
long Winter evenings these farmer and fisher folk
were wont to amuse and scare themselves, as well as
the children, by relating all manner of ghostly experiences.
Mrs. Henry Davis recalls how, as a child, she
used to crawl up to bed so terrified after an evening
of witch stories that she could hardly move, her one
thought being to get under the bed clothes as quickly
as possible, where she would all but smother.</p>

<p class='c004'>Under such circumstances the ghost of a witch
was a powerful combination for evil, and particularly
so when it was such a witch as old Moll, who was so
much a terror to the neighborhood that there was talk
of burning her in order to rid the community of her
undesirable presence, but fortunately she died before
this feeling culminated in a tragedy. Mrs. Henry
Davis well remembers hearing her mother (a former
Miss King) tell this as a fact.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>BODY SNATCHING.</h4>
<p class='c006'>In the early days of the cemetery, when it was inclosed
by a high wooden fence, there was considerable
<a id='Page_12'></a>talk of body-snatching, and one of the men in
charge of the grounds was strongly suspected.</p>

<p class='c004'>Old Mrs. Holt walking down the Gully road one
night saw, standing in the darkest shadow, an old
fashioned undertaker’s wagon, and hearing voices of
men, stepped back among the bushes out of harm’s
way. Soon she saw three men against the night sky
standing on the high ground of the cemetery. One
carried a lantern while the other two had a long
bundle shrouded in white. He with the lantern
stopped on the ridge, while the others kept down the
slope. Now they lifted their bundle to the top of the
fence where one man steadied it while the other
climbed over. When both were over the body was
taken down and placed in the wagon. The man on the
hill, whose voice Mrs. Holt recognized, called good-night
to the men in the road and they responded as
the wagon rapidly drove toward Newark.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE DEVIL IN THE GULLY ROAD.</h4>
<p class='c006'>How John Thompson saw the Devil in the Gully
road was once told by himself in a moment of great
confidence, for ordinarily he would never speak of the
adventure.</p>

<p class='c004'>About ’68 or ’69 John worked for Mr. Melius
on the River road, and it was noticed that when called
on to drive down town after dusk for his employer
he invariably went the long way round—Grafton and
Washington avenues—and when coming back with
Mr. M. he would shut his mouth the moment they
<a id='Page_13'></a>entered within the dark precincts of the Gully and say
never a word until they were well beyond the black
shadow of its overhanging trees.</p>

<p class='c004'>It seems that John was originally a river man and
that he sailored under Captain Nichols, whose profanity
was one of his notable points; he had a varied
assortment of swear-words and a proficiency in their
use that made the efforts of ordinary mortals pale into
insignificance.</p>

<p class='c004'>For some reason not explained the schooner was
held up in Newark one day, and as the Captain lived
in Belleville there was nothing for it but to walk home.
John Thompson went along for, of course, neither one
of the seamen thought much of the storm that was
raging, even if the rain did come down in torrents
which soaked them through.</p>

<p class='c004'>It certainly did look dark and creepy to John as he
peered into the black hole of the Gully road, and
though he was himself a gentleman of color and
matched up with a dark night first rate, he ever
fancied daylight for such places, but the Captain went
plunging on into the shadows and John could but
follow.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Captain had used up his stock of cuss-words,
and while in the very darkest part of the tunnel commenced
all over again and was going fine when a sudden,
blinding flash of lightning discovered to John,
who was in the rear, a third man walking between
them and chuckling every time the Captain swore.
Before the light went out John saw that the man was
<a id='Page_14'></a>dressed like a parson and that his clothes appeared
to be dry in spite of the heavy downpour. A second
flash showed a most alarming state of things: the
stranger was on fire, smoke or steam was escaping
from every crevice, but still he chuckled as the Captain
ripped out all manner of strange oaths, and did
not seem to pay any attention to his own internal combustion;
even in the dark his glee could be heard
bubbling forth, nor could the pounding of the storm
drown it. By this time the Captain’s attention was
also attracted, and when a third flash enabled them to
see that their unknown companion had hoofs their
worst suspicions were realized and both men broke
and ran for Belleville as fast as two pairs of scared
legs could carry them, while the Devil laughed long
and loud at their dismay.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>A LOVER’S LANE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Another man once ran against a cow in the Gully
road one dark night and was considerably worked up
over the adventure for the moment. The unfortunate
part of it was that he lingered long enough to discover
that it was a cow, else we might have had another
story of these darksome terrors. The horns and
hoofs were there, and all that was needed was a little
more imagination and not quite so much practicality.
But not all the stories of the Gully road are of such
fearful things as these. It was a way of surpassing
beauty when lighted by the sun, and a lover’s lane
that fairly blossomed with loving couples on pleasant
Sunday afternoons, when the sighing of the wind in
<a id='Page_15'></a>the trees was but an echo of the happy sighs below.
Many a life contract has been signed, sealed and delivered
within its confines; in fact I have heard of
one youth who proposed on the way back from a boat
race, the romantic influence of the place with its
glamor of shady nooks being quite too much for his
equanimity.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>GHOST OF A BRITISH SPY.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Then there was the English spy who, legend says,
was captured by a party of Americans and promptly
hanged on the limb of a large tree that stood at the
bend of the road. His ghost was for long a sad handicap
to the neighborhood and, singular as it may seem,
he is said to have played his wildest pranks with those
who placed the greatest faith in him. But since the
spread of the Mount Pleasant Cemetery down toward
his abode little or nothing has been heard of his doings.
One theory is that of late he has come within
the orbits of so many other ghosts, but of a more respectable
and orderly character, that he has become
inextricably tangled, much as is reported of wireless
messages when many amateurs assault the air.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>HENRY WILLIAM HERBERT.</h4>
<p class='c006'>About fifty years ago Henry William Herbert, who
wrote under the name of Frank N. Forrester, resided
on the river bank within the present limits of the cemetery,
his place being known as “The Cedars”. A
queer, romantic figure about which much of fiction as
well as truth has been woven.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_16'></a>To Mr. Boyden and others, whose youth was spent
about here, this strange figure was a familiar sight, for
the recluse used almost daily to walk down town, his
shoulders enveloped in a shawl, and always with a
troop of dogs at his heels. Those who so remember
him rather resent the fact that his brawls have been
made much of and his virtues neglected by such as
write of him, for they recall him as an attractive man
and pleasant companion with many kindly qualities.
Herbert generally made a call at the Black Horse
tavern which then stood at the “Stone Bridge”, and
after a short stay would continue on to the Park
House. He was apt to be brusque with those he did
not like, and when “beyond his depth” through too
great conviviality inclined to be ugly when opposed.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was born in London April 7, 1807, and was
educated at an English college. He came to New
York in 1831, supporting himself by teaching and
later by writing short stories, historical novels and
books on sports, his “Field Sports of America” soon
making his name a familiar one to the lovers of gun
and rod.</p>

<p class='c004'>A Newarker, who has written of him from personal
knowledge, says:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is a difficult matter to sift the good from the
bad in Herbert’s character. He was in truth a most
rare and singular being if he did not possess some
virtues.</p>

<p class='c004'>“When writing his celebrated work, ‘Field Sports
of America’, he had access to the Newark Library;
<a id='Page_17'></a>not content with the privileges there afforded, he cut
out bodily leaves from ‘The Encyclopedia Britannica’,
evidently unmindful of the selfishness and criminality
of the act. There are some men made up of inconsistencies,
and a strange agglomeration of moods.
Herbert was one of them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is nothing associated with Herbert’s life
that is apt to strike a stranger favorably. He was a
direct antithesis of Irving, who possessed a certain
magnetic influence. The truth is Irving was a good
man and Herbert was not. Herbert was endowed
with rare genius, and those who have a desire to become
convinced of this fact should read his works;
they tower as far above the general literary productions
of to-day as does the Oregon pine over the
tender sapling. His characters are finely drawn—not
overdrawn—his heroines are as pure as the purest,
and his villains—distinctive in their characteristics—‘act
well their parts’. Though not an extensive verse
writer, Herbert was the author of some very creditable
poetry, his translation of Æschylus’s ‘Prometheus
Bound’ and ‘Agamemnon’ show ripe scholarship
and otherwise redound to his credit.</p>

<p class='c004'>“In several of his novels the subject of this sketch
has portrayed his own character far better than it has
been or can be done by another. Whatever Herbert’s
defects, as an author he was of the highest
order; he was a voluminous writer and a fine translator.
‘Marmaduke Wyvil’, ‘Cromwell’ and ‘The
Roman Traitor’ are works that stand in the front
<a id='Page_18'></a>rank of their class, while among his translations M.
Thiers’s ‘Life of the First Consul’ is one of the
standard works of literature. In his historical novels
he approaches nearer Sir Walter Scott than any author
I have been privileged to read. He was, in fact,
a dual character—an enigma. His genius merits admiration,
and it is safe to say that his fame will not
die with the century that gave him birth.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Many are the stories told to show his eccentric
character and occasional violence. During summer
days he would place himself on the bank of the river
with a gun and threaten to shoot passing boatmen
unless they came on shore at his bidding, but no
sooner did they land than Herbert would disappear,
leaving the affrighted oarsmen in a state of perplexity
as to what next. It sounds much like a fool trick from
this distance, but his reputation made the experience
anything but a pleasant one.</p>

<p class='c004'>Conviviality was the order of the night at The
Cedars, Herbert being much in the habit of inviting
friends to enjoy what he termed the hospitality of the
place. On one such occasion four guests were drinking
with him, when the host suddenly sprang to his feet
and produced from a small closet two swords and,
throwing one on the table, ordered one of those present
to defend himself. Recognizing that the affair
might terminate seriously, one of the guests kicked
over the table, throwing the lamp to the floor and enveloping
the room in sudden darkness. The party
“broke up” then and there, and the company made for
<a id='Page_19'></a>the Gully road that they might live to fight another
day. Herbert was thoroughly crazed by this time,
and chased his friends up to and down Belleville
avenue. Finally the pursued separated and the pursuer
kept on after one of them even to the Black Horse
tavern (Broad street and Belleville avenue), where an
escape was effected.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE HARE AND TORTOISE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>A race modeled on Æsop’s fable is by no means
an everyday occurrence, but Herbert was by no means
an everyday citizen. He seems to have been as fond
of a joke as he is said to have been of a bottle, and
these two loves furnished a modern version of
the Hare and Tortoise fable. The following facts are
given me by Mr. James S. Taylor, who was an eye
witness of the event, and who secured missing details
from one of the participants later.</p>

<p class='c004'>But before going on with the story suppose we hear
what the local poet had to say on the subject:—</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE HARE AND THE TORTOISE.</h4>
<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>This is the tale of a race</div>
      <div class='line'>That long years gone took place</div>
      <div class='line'>On the broad river Passaic</div>
      <div class='line'>When times were archaic,</div>
      <div class='line'>And here are the facts in the case:</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>One Herbert of eccentric renown</div>
      <div class='line'>Challenged a friend, of the town,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a supper of game</div>
      <div class='line'>Should be prize for the same,</div>
      <div class='line'>And with plenty of wine washed down.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_20'></a>The challenged was clumsy at rowing</div>
      <div class='line'>And his boat very poor was at going,</div>
      <div class='line'>While Herbert’s was light</div>
      <div class='line'>And his rowing a sight</div>
      <div class='line'>To set all his backers a-crowing.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But, like the hare in the ancient race,</div>
      <div class='line'>Herbert likewise did slacken his pace,</div>
      <div class='line'>And soon sought his ease</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Neath the leaves where the trees</div>
      <div class='line'>On the waters their shadows did trace.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A bottle he had from the vine</div>
      <div class='line'>And was having a jolly good time,</div>
      <div class='line'>When his friend labored by,</div>
      <div class='line'>To whom Herbert did cry:</div>
      <div class='line'>“Stop in and have sup of my wine.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But the tortoise kept steadily at work</div>
      <div class='line'>While the hare on the bank still did shirk—</div>
      <div class='line'>Where drink of the gods held him fast,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where the cool, dark shadows were cast</div>
      <div class='line'>And the scent of wild flowers did lurk.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The end came as it should in such case,</div>
      <div class='line'>For the tortoise, though slow, won the race,</div>
      <div class='line'>And ’twas Herbert who paid for that supper of game.</div>
      <div class='line'>The story is ended, but for details of same</div>
      <div class='line'>We’ll drop into prose for a space.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Herbert was well acquainted with Frank Harrison,
veteran of the war with Mexico and keeper of the
North Ward Hotel on Broad street, opposite Bridge.
At some convivial point in his existence he suggested
<a id='Page_21'></a>to Harrison that the two have a boat race on the Passaic,
from Belleville to Newark, the prize to be a game
supper, and the latter, being game himself, though no
boatman, accepted the challenge.</p>

<p class='c004'>The only condition or obligation of the race was
that they should start together, and that the first man
to cross the finishing line should win. Each could
choose his own boat and suit himself as to rowing.
Herbert, living on the river, had a light boat which
he knew how to handle, was familiar with the currents
and eddies and was moreover a good oarsman,
while his opponent knew nothing of the Passaic or its
ways. The day was warm, the start was made on
time and Harrison received the inverted plaudits of the
company assembled for the occasion, for it seemed to
these wise ones that there could be but one end to such
an event. Herbert was away promptly and soon out
of sight around the bend where Second river loses its
identity, while the dispenser of strong waters was yet
finding himself, but as he rowed our eccentric friend
became warm and a black bottle, which he had
brought along for company, looked up at him from
the bottom of the boat with an invitation he could not
resist.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was now well on his way and still his antagonist
was not in sight, therefore, hurry seemed out
of place, and then the cool depths of the tree-shaded
river bank looked inviting and, thinking to tarry but
a moment, he put the boat about for the shore.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once on shore and stretched at his ease the necessity
<a id='Page_22'></a>for any race at all did not appear plain to our
hero and he gurgled the time away, blissfully careless
as to what might happen out in the hot sunshine.
Thus the second boat came along, passed and continued
on down toward the goal. Possibly Herbert
thought he could at any time overtake his clumsy antagonist,
possibly he did not go so far in his speculations;
whatever his idea was, the tortoise won the
race and the game supper.</p>

<p class='c004'>Herbert shot himself in the Stevens House, New
York, on May 17, 1858. He was buried in Mount
Pleasant Cemetery, overlooking the river he knew so
well, and his epitaph, which he is said to have suggested
himself, is the single Latin word “Infelice”.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>EARLIER DWELLERS SOUTH OF THE GULLY ROAD.</h4>
<p class='c006'>In 1743 a Dr. Edward Pigot lived hereabouts, as
is noted in the Town Meeting of that year, quoted
elsewhere; who he was or whence he came is not
for me to say. In 1791 Abraham Sandford, Jr., and
Elisha Sandford, lived in an old house on the site of
the Herbert house, while building the Sandford dwelling,
which still stands nearly opposite the Point
House. As early as 1680 the property was owned by
Henry Rowe, and remained in the possession of the
family until about 1812. Mary Rowe, a witch, lived
in a cabin here, and may be the same person referred
to elsewhere as Moll De Grow.</p>

<p class='c004'>After that I find no record of a dwelling here
until Herbert built. After his death this house was
<a id='Page_23'></a>occupied for a short time by Mr. Joseph S. Rano, a
shoemaker by trade, and a great hunter and a haunter
of the river and its banks; then came Mr. Sanchez y
Dolce, who resided here until the dwelling was destroyed
by fire. Then came the cemetery, and it is
now the dwelling place of many dead.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>GREEN ISLAND.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Those who only know the Passaic of to-day can
hardly realize that there was once a “Green Island”
lying off the northern end of Mount Pleasant Cemetery
which was a noted rendezvous for wild ducks and
geese, with enough water between it and the shore
to enable river craft to navigate the channel.</p>

<p class='c004'>This Green Island was a thorn in the side of the
cemetery people, who purchased it for $ 1,000, or
thought they did; but soon came those who bluffed
them into buying it over again, and this time they
paid $10,000. When the Erie came it claimed that the
cemetery had no rights in Green Island at all, and
calmly pre-empted it for trackage purposes.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>OF FISH AND FISHING.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Seventy-five years ago this was a hunter’s paradise,
and even within the memory of some of us old codgers
the fishing for shad and smelts was a well established
industry. In fact, the fishing rights of Green Island
were for hire, as I am told that one could rent them
for a day or a week and do his own fishing. Old Fink,
whoever he was, once gathered in five hundred shad
in one haul; at least one of his contemporaries does
<a id='Page_24'></a>solemnly affirm such to have been the case, and another
as calmly tells me that fourteen bushels of
smelts were the reward of two hauls, of which he had
cognizance.</p>

<p class='c004'>This almost sounds as if we were again on the
lake of Gennesaret. But still greater wonders are recorded
by Mr. William Stimis, eighty-seven years
of age, who has heard his father say that he had seen
1,200 shad caught in one haul, and he, William, with
three others, gathered in 120 bushels of smelts in one
night. He also tells of a striped bass weighing sixty-six
pounds, sturgeon six feet long and of a host of
lesser fish that swam the Passaic.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE SMELT OF THE PASSAIC RIVER.</h4>
<p class='c006'>In Graham’s American Monthly Magazine, 1854,
appears a “Memoir on the Smelt of the Passaic River”,
by Frank Forrester, from which the following brief
facts are taken:—</p>

<p class='c004'>The author was fond of classical allusions and
high sounding phrases, and devotes two of his four
pages to telling us how much he knows of things that
do not pertain to the subject in hand, but when he
gets down to “the delicious little fish known as the
Smelt” we learn that it is the smallest of the salmon
family, that the American smelt is larger than, and
superior to, the European variety, and that its zoological
name “osmerus” is from the Greek, and means “to
give forth a perfume”, this having reference to the
peculiar odor of cucumbers it exhales when fresh.</p>

<p class='c004'>The smelt of the Passaic and Raritan rivers was
<a id='Page_25'></a>an entirely different fish from that of the Connecticut
and more eastern rivers, and commanded a far higher
price in the New York markets, though much smaller,
the majority being under six inches in length while
the eastern smelt averages eleven to twelve inches.
The whole fish was of the most brilliant pearly silver,
with the slightest possible changeable hue of greenish
blue along the back, “The peculiar cucumber odor, in
the freshly caught fish, and the extreme delicacy of
the flesh, both of which are (1854) so far superior in
the fish of the Passaic, as to be obvious to the least
inquisitive observer”. This Passaic smelt Mr. Herbert
found agreed in every particular with the description
of the European smelt.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the springs of 1853-4 no school of fish, either
shad or smelt, ran up the river owing, it was believed,
to the establishment of a chain ferry about a mile
above Newark bay. Mr. Herbert never knew of a
well authenticated case where the smelt had been
taken with bait, but states that they could be taken
with the scarlet Ibis fly, and that he had himself killed
them thus on the Passaic.</p>

<p class='c004'>Two well known figures of the Green Island waters
were those of the “Two Horaces”, as they were
called, Messrs. Horace H. Nichols and Horace Carter,
brothers-in-law, neighbors and good friends. They
constructed a comfortable boat for the purpose and
might have been seen almost any pleasant afternoon,
when the fishing was on, placidly waiting for a bite.</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_26'></a>
  <h4 class='c008'>THE POINT HOUSE.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>When the Erie came it drove spiles into the tender
bosom of Green Island, and in time filled in a solid
road bed, and where we once hunted for the roots and
buds of the calamus docks have been built and filled
in, and our island has lost its identity. All this filling
has so changed the outline of the river bank that it is
not now evident why the “Point House” was so
named, though there was a time when this was a well
developed point.</p>

<p class='c004'>Accounts differ somewhat as to the old-time owners
of the Point House property, even the same man
does not altogether agree with himself on this point.
It is said that Judge Elias Boudinot, a Newarker,
secured the property from the state, there being no
other claimant for it. It was probably purchased on
November 12, 1799, from the Judge by Abraham Van
Emburgh who, about 1810-14, left suddenly for parts
unknown because of a financial panic in the Van Emburgh
family.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>The Point House. Said to be 150 years old. The scene of many a story and incident.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The property was sold by order of the court on July
24, 1811, to Thomas Whitlock who, on August 22,
1811, sold it to Peter Sandford; his heirs disposed of
it on February 8, 1832, to William Duncan, John Cunningham,
Sebastian Duncan and John Duncan. Another
account makes Simeon Stivers an owner one
hundred years ago, and also mentions one William
Glasby and Miles I’Anson as subsequent owners.</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_27'></a>
  <h4 class='c008'>PHŒBE KING AND THE POINT HOUSE.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>That the Point House was a place of resort at an
early date would appear from the following anecdote
told me by Mrs. R. H. Brewster, a granddaughter of
that Phœbe King who furnished the original material
for the story, and who lived just below in the King
house. The incident occurred before 1820, and came
to Mrs. Brewster from her mother.</p>

<p class='c004'>During certain seasons of the year the men of the
neighborhood were in the habit of going on what were
known as fishing trips on the river, but though they
fished within sight of their own doors, they would
remain away from home for two or three days, using
the Point House, which was then run by a woman,
as headquarters, and here they indulged in what were
technically known as “fish dinners”, and these fish
dinners, it would appear, were conducive to more or
less conviviality. The fact that “Poddy”, husband of
Phœbe, was much troubled with gout in later years
may have been due to an excess of fish, or something
taken at this time—however this is merely surmise.</p>

<p class='c004'>Phœbe, it seems, came to the conclusion that her
good man was eating too many fish dinners, and she
said something to this effect, even going so far, when
no attention was paid to her first hint, as to suggest
that she might blow up the Point House if “Poddy”
did not change his method of fishing, but he forgot
all about it the next time one of his cronies came along
and off he went again. Thus things ran along some
two years or more until one day Phœbe discovered a
<a id='Page_28'></a>ladder standing against the side of the Point House,
next the kitchen chimney, at a time when a “fish dinner”
was hatching, and as our story opens a great
chowder was brewing over the fire at the bottom of
that chimney. Phœbe saw her opportunity and
grasped it; procuring a long string, a small bag and
what she thought was powder enough to give the fisherman
a scare, she proceeded to work. But as the result
shows she underestimated the ability of good
black powder to do things.</p>

<p class='c004'>With the powder inclosed in the bag and the bag
fast to one end of the string the good wife cautiously
ascended to the roof and, carefully placing the bag
just over the chimney’s edge, she then came back to
earth and, walking as far as the string would permit,
let it go and hurried home. The result was even more
conclusive than she had anticipated, for the explosion
that followed not only distributed the chowder with
absolute impartiality to the expectant company gathered
around the hearth, but also removed a portion of
the chimney.</p>

<p class='c004'>It would appear that at that time there was a
witch in the neighborhood, possibly old Moll DeGrow,
whose power for evil was generally recognized,
and the recipients of the chowder promptly came to the
conclusion that the witch was at the bottom of the
trouble, all but “Poddy”. He had a light, and
hastened home with it, but there sat Phœbe, placidly
spinning and greatly surprised at his tale of woe, and
though he tried to get up an argument over the matter
<a id='Page_29'></a>it lacked success, being much too one-sided, and
it was many years before he was allowed to verify his
suspicions. In the meantime fish dinners at the Point
House went out of fashion, the new method of serving
chowder not being looked on with favor.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE POINT HOUSE WORKS FOR A LIVING.</h4>
<p class='c006'>For several years the Duncans carried on the
printing and dyeing of silk handkerchiefs in the Point
House, probably the first enterprise of this sort established
in the vicinity of Newark. They secured the
raw silk in New York and, after converting it into the
finished article, one of the brothers would make up a
bundle of handkerchiefs and trudge to New York with
it. On leaving this place the Duncans established
the woolen mills in Franklin, N. J., which have since
been known as the Essex Works.</p>

<p class='c004'>Apparently the next use to which the point was
put was for the transshipping of freight, for we are
told that rather more than fifty years ago this was a
landing where vessels unloaded coal and other commodities
which those from the back country, even so
far as Bloomfield, were wont to cart home by way of
the Division road and Murphy’s lane.</p>

<p class='c004'>About 1855 our old Point House, which some say
was built 150 years ago, was owned by George Jackson,
who manufactured fireworks here, while his
brother Charles followed the same trade in a small
building just north. He is said to have paid $400 for
the property. About once in so often the fireworks
factory would explode, and it made such a nuisance of
<a id='Page_30'></a>itself because of these irregular excursions heavenward
that Mr. Gould, who lived just across the way,
purchased the property in order to quiet his nerves.</p>

<p class='c004'>From fireworks to firewater sounds like an easy
transition, and so we come to the Holt regime. The
Holts and a brother of Mrs. Holt, Ed. Moorehouse,
lived in the King house (which we have passed without
knowing it, and to which we shall go back shortly)
and some time before 1865 removed to the Point
House, and here again was trouble for the neighbors,
for while this was not a regular tavern, it would appear
that a certain black bottle was part of its furniture,
and that that black bottle was a magnet which
no servant girl of the time and region could resist.
Now a drunken cook is not generally regarded as any
great addition to the family menage, as I am informed.
It was no small undertaking to find a cook who would
go so far into the country as this region then was, and
when found, to have her almost immediately go astray
via the Point House, was considered highly provoking.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Holts made their own root beer, and there is
a story to the effect that while a party of well known
Newarkers was in the place one day a keg of this
same beer, which stood on the bar, exploded and
deluged the visitors with a combination of liquid sassafras
and wintergreen that was shocking to see and
worse to bear, and it is recorded that those inundated
failed to discover a funny side to the experience.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE FLOATING PALACE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The “Floating Palace”, kept by Ed. Holt, appears
<a id='Page_31'></a> to have been a laudable effort on his part to
benefit his friends and neighbors by catering to those
who frequented the river. This was a boat anchored
in the middle of the stream, which was reached by
customers in small boats. It appears to be commonly
thought that Ed. had a government license, but no
local permit to retail liquor, and the boat was supposed
to overcome the difficulty by straddling the
county line. But one who knew Ed. well and knew
the kind of a place he kept tells me that he sold nothing
stronger than beer, and endeavored in every way
to keep the boat of such a character that respectable
parties could stop for refreshment, and that he was
ably seconded in this by his Scotch-Irish wife, whose
influence was all for good. Under more favorable circumstances
Ed. Holt might have developed into a
leading citizen. He was a man of character and of
very temperate habits himself; a carpenter by trade,
he always refused to employ men who were habitual
drinkers.</p>

<p class='c004'>For a short time there was a second floating palace
anchored in Dead Man’s bend, nearly opposite the
lower end of Green Island, which was thoroughly disreputable,
and it is probable that the reputation of this
was unjustly extended to Holt’s place, for many people
are to-day of the opinion that the latter was not as
clean as it might have been. The Floating Palace
burned to the water’s edge while Ed. Holt was still
proprietor, and the experiment was not tried again.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Point House was long known to oarsmen as
<a id='Page_32'></a>the training ground of some of the famed scullers of
the world. Captain Chris. Van Emburgh, mariner,
was one of the noted characters who frequented the
place; he was an old Passaic river skipper and came
originally from its eastern bank.</p>

<p class='c004'>Quite within the memory of those who are now
beginning to be numbered with the older inhabitants,
the place was one of the picturesque features of the
river. Here were benches placed beneath the graceful
willows which adorned the banks of the point; it
was a good vantage ground from which to view the
boat races when the local Tritons were trying their
powers of endurance against outside barbarians.
There were boats to let here, as full many a lover
knew. But as the river became more and more foul
such diversions ceased, and to-day the Point House
stands shorn of all its old time attractions.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>OLD BLACK TOM.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Old Black Tom was a well known, and many times
damned, neighbor of the Point House. This was a
large rock which lay almost in the middle of the channel,
which at this point came close in to the western
shore; at low water it was just covered, and one of
the amusements of the boys was to step on the rock
from a boat, when the person so doing had the appearance
of walking on the water. But what was not
so amusing, at least to the river men, was for a boat
to run on the rock when the tide was falling. The
canal boats which carried bricks or coal above frequently
fell victims and, as every one knows how earnestly
<a id='Page_33'></a>a rusty canaler talks when excited, there is no
need to attempt a reproduction here.</p>

<p class='c004'>It seemed natural to step from Green Island to the
Point House and now, having disposed of the latter,
we shall go back as far as the Gully road.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE KING PROPERTY.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Just at the bend of the road on the north side stood,
within the memory of man, a pump which was long a
popular warm weather resort. This was on the old
King property. Just when the first King came here,
or where from, has not been ascertained; all we know
is that a Jasper King was living at the junction of the
Gully and River roads, an old man, at the time of the
Revolution, and that his son, whose name is not now
recalled, was a soldier under General Anthony Wayne
and was killed in action. He is said to have been one
of those who crossed the Delaware with Washington.</p>

<p class='c004'>This son left one child, a son named Jasper, born
July 18, 1775, who was brought up by his grandfather.
Because of the confusion of tongues due to the similarity
of name, the younger Jasper was nicknamed
“Poddy”, this being a sort of explanatory title which
is supposed to have described his midship section.</p>

<p class='c004'>This grandson enlisted for the War of 1812 and
was stationed at Sandy Hook, he never saw active
service in the field, but served his time out and was
honorably discharged. He married Phœbe Budd,
January 6, 1795, and about 1817 built the house which
formerly stood in the bend of the road. Mrs. Henry
<a id='Page_34'></a>Davis, a granddaughter of this Jasper, recalls having
heard her mother relate how, when Jasper was a very
young child, he was taken by his mother to see the
husband and father off to the war, and how the mother
lifted him up so that the father, who was on horseback,
could kiss the child good-bye. The father was
killed in action and the child never saw him again.</p>

<p class='c004'>The poorly shod condition of the soldiers at this
time led to the throwing of their caps in the snow to
stand in while waiting for the order to march. (This
same tradition has also been handed down in the
Phillips family, as noted elsewhere).</p>

<p class='c004'>A story current in the King family indicates that
a detachment of British or Hessian troops was camped
at one time near the King house. For it is told how
the young child Jasper was induced by these soldiers
to bring them apples and potatoes from his grandfather’s
cellar. He was too young to appreciate what
he was doing, but the grandfather soon caught him at
it, and put a stop to it. This story would indicate that
the invaders were not always such merciless marauders
as is generally supposed. The orchard from which
these apples came was situated on the Gibbs’ hill and
was noted for the fine quality of its fruit.</p>

<p class='c004'>The last Jasper, who died October 1, 1854, had two
sons, William and John, and eight daughters. John
was a ship-builder, his yard being located in North
Belleville. William was a brass molder and later had
a sash and blind factory in Newark; he was noted as
<a id='Page_35'></a>a temperance lecturer and traveled the country over
in the cause.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>A REVOLUTIONARY INCIDENT.</h4>
<p class='c006'>One of the incidents of the Revolutionary period
had somewhat to do with the King house. A son of
Joseph Hedden, Jr., “the martyr patriot” of Newark,
escaped from his father’s house while the British
soldiers were dragging the senior out of his bed and
into the street. The boy, though but half clad, jumped
from a window and ran to the Passaic river at Lombardy
street and up the river on the ice and snow to
the Gully road.</p>

<p class='c004'>He stopped at the older King house for information
and such scant clothing as they could afford
to share with him and, believing that the soldiers were
after him left by the Gully road for the Long Hill or
Bloomfield road, where he found refuge in the house
of a friend named Morris and was furnished with
stimulants, food and clothing, and had his frozen feet
treated.</p>

<p class='c004'>The King house was later included in the Gibbs
purchase and was occupied by the gardener employed
by Mr. Gibbs, and while so used it was destroyed
by fire. Mrs. Gibbs remembers the building as a typical
old frame farm house snuggled down under the
shelter of the hill, embowered in roses and so
picturesquely situated as to make her long for the
simple life.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>BURIED TREASURE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>There have been many stories in the past of Captain
<a id='Page_36'></a>Kidd and his buried treasure, and there has been
much digging in the fields hereabout by those who
would acquire riches without due process of labor,
but the only find that I have heard of occurred where
the Gully road joins the River road.</p>

<p class='c004'>The building of the Erie Railroad necessitated a
change where the Gully becomes the River road, and
a strip some eighty feet wide was lopped off the
Gibbs property. When the fence was moved back
certain articles of silver were dug up by the workmen
in the slender triangle which now lies between
the drive and the railroad. The matter was kept
quiet, presumably through fear that the stuff would
be claimed, and the pieces disappeared before any one
could inspect them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Where this occurred would have been just in
front of the older King house and it is possible that
these articles were family treasures buried during
the Revolution in fear of a British raid.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>WHEN BRITON MET BRITON.</h4>
<p class='c006'>A story has come down from the elders to the effect
that at some point in the game of war two detachments
of British troops were foraging in this region
apparently each “unbeknownst” to the other, for
the legend has it that while one was on the River road
nearly opposite Jasper King’s, the other, which was
on higher ground, mistook them for the enemy and
fired a volley among them, whereupon the hirelings
rushed for the cover of the river bank, which was
much higher then than now, and in their excitement
<a id='Page_37'></a>threw their guns into the river. Some of these guns
were recovered after the war by fishermen.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THORNHILL.</h4>
<p class='c006'>What has been known to most of those now living
as the Gibbs house is an imposing brown stone edifice
which was built by Governor Pennington for his
daughter Mary when she became the wife of Hugh
Toler. In due time the place was sold to Mr. Alfred
H. Gibbs, and has since been known as Thornhill. It
was a sightly place with the river at its feet.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE TERHUNE PLACE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The next place north was that known of late as
the Terhune place, which stands just above the Riverside
station. The original dweller on or near this site
is said to have been a Maverick, but nothing more
than this is known. Then came one Matthew Banks
who, according to story, was so lazy that he hoed his
corn on horseback. Mr. Banks was quite as much
fisherman as farmer, and spent much of his time on
the river, and they do say that the old fellow would
turn a penny now and then by selling herring for shad
to the unsophisticated. Older residents tell me that
there was formerly a hill of some altitude between
this place and the river which cut out any view of the
water from the house, and to which children were
taken on Fourth of July nights as a vantage point
from which to view the fireworks. Mr. Banks came
here about 1820 and was possibly the last slave owner
in this neighborhood. He is said to have purchased
<a id='Page_38'></a>a negro from John Hawthorn, the quarryman, and,
when he sold the place, among the chattels he wished
to dispose of was a colored boy aged 14 years, “used
to farm work”.</p>

<p class='c004'>After Matthew Banks a Mr. Small, who was the
head printer in the Daily Advertiser office, took up his
residence here, and following him, if I have the history
right, came Mr. Terhune, who built the present house.
Here also lived Mr. Horace Carter while his own
dwelling was building on the Gully road, and thus we
come to modern times.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>SANDFORD.</h4>
<p class='c006'>“Second day of July in the year of our Lord one
thousand seven hundred and ninety-one, Abraham
Sandford, Jr., of New Barbadoes Bergen County,
bought from Thomas Eagles and wife Mary a certain
parcel of land. Beginning at the road that leads from
Newark to Second river at the east corner of the land
of Abraham Stivers”, etc. So runs the old deed which
announces the advent of the Sandford family on this
side of the river.</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain William Sandford, the original settler of
the name in this country, came from the Barbadoes
Islands in 1668 as the representative of Nathaniel
Kingsland “of the same Island of Barbadoes, Esq.”
He purchased “all that Neck of Land lying and being
between Pisaick and Hackingsack Rivers”. The lower
seven miles of this tract beginning at Newark bay and
extending to the copper mine, and “Commonly then
known by the name of New Barbadoes” fell in due
<a id='Page_39'></a>course to Captain Sandford. The Captain was a noted
man in his day. In 1682 he was commissioned Attorney
of the Province, in 1699 he was appointed by
Governor Carteret one of his two deputy governors
during the absence of the Governor in England; he
was for years in the Governor’s Council and prominent
in affairs of church and state.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Abraham Sandford, Jr., who was the first of
the name to settle on the west bank of the Passaic,
was a great-great-grandson of William Sandford. He
built the house (1794-5) which still stands, but in a
greatly remodeled condition, just below and opposite
the Point House, and which is to-day occupied by his
grandchildren. As the family grew and multiplied
this particular branch was known as the “Pine Tree
Sandfords”, owing to the fact that a magnificent tree
of the species long flourished near the dwelling.</p>

<p class='c004'>The tract originally purchased by Abraham Sandford,
Jr., comprised about thirty acres, extending to
the Back road. In 1801 he added to his possessions
by purchasing the river front from Simeon Stivers,
and in 1817 bought an adjoining half acre from Stewart
Elder. Abraham, Jr., had three children: Susan,
Maria and Abraham A. The son married Charity Yansen,
whose father was a soldier of the Revolution;
they resided on the homestead; their children were
Elizabeth M., Emma L., Mary O. and Frank. The
first and last of these still live in the old house.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>POLLY VAN WINKLE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Polly Van Winkle was one of the picturesque
<a id='Page_40'></a>figures of the River road some two or three generations
ago. The neighbors appear to have stood in
some fear of her lest she take offense and vent her
displeasure by setting fire to their property; thus she
came and went much as it pleased her. She appears
to have had no home of her own, but carried all her
worldly goods in a pack on her back, and when she
appeared at some door it was to walk in and make
herself at home, declining to go no matter how broad
the hints that were dropped. She never wished a bed,
always preferring to sleep on the floor close to her
bundle, which was never allowed to leave her sight.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>MUNN.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Next as we progress northward is the Munn house.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Munns came to America from England or
Wales, and were among the early Newark settlers
from New England. Captain Benjamin Munn of
Hartford, Conn., served in the Pequot Indian War of
1637. He removed to Springfield, 1649; was probably
killed by the Indians, 1675. His two sons, John and
James, were in the Indian fight at Turners Falls, 1676.
John settled in Westfield, died 1684, leaving a widow
and two sons, John and Benjamin. The widow married,
1686, John Richards, the schoolmaster of Westfield,
and removed with him and her two boys to
Deerfield, where his house was burned in the destruction
of the town by the French and Indians in 1704.
A few years afterward he removed to Newark, N. J.,
where he was the schoolmaster in 1718. His stepson,
John Munn, married Mary, sister of John Richards
<a id='Page_41'></a>and widow of John Ward, about 1720, and had Joseph,
Samuel and Benjamin. Benjamin was born 1730 and
died 1818—lived all his life on his farm, now the town
of East Orange. Two of his sons, David and Amos,
served in the Revolutionary War. After the war
Amos married a daughter of Silas Dod and settled in
Bloomfield—died in 1808, leaving Silas and other children.
Silas continued his business till 1825, when he
removed with his wife and two boys, William Alonzo
and Bethuel, to the old Col. Van Cortland place on
the Passaic, just below the mouth of Second river.
Here he resided five years—1825-1830—during which
time his son Henry Benson and daughter Emeline
were born. He then moved to Belleville, where he
lost his daughter Emeline, and where his son Silas, Jr.,
was born.</p>

<p class='c004'>In 1850 he purchased the Van Emburgh place, consisting
of four or five acres, opposite the old Point
House.</p>

<p class='c004'>This tract was conveyed on June 7, 1790, by Gaspars
Van Winkle and wife and Aurentee Due, heirs
of Gideon and Mary Smith, to Abraham Van Emburgh.
Most of the property remained in the Van
Emburgh family until sold to Silas Munn, March 16,
1850. At this time there were two small dwellings
on the land, one was moved back and converted into
a barn, the other was moved, remodeled and added to
in 1893 and is still standing. Here Silas died in 1873.</p>

<p class='c004'>The children of Silas were William Alonzo, Bethuel,
Silas, Henry Benson and Emeline. William
<a id='Page_42'></a>Alonzo married a sister of John Boyd of Woodside,
and removed to New York; his second wife was Hannah
Wilson, with whom he removed to Milwaukee,
where he died in 1876. Bethuel married Sarah, another
sister of John Boyd, and after the death of his
mother, in 1866, occupied the house on the River road
until his decease in 1899. Henry Benson studied law,
moved to Madison and Portage City, Wis., of which
latter place he was elected mayor, and from which he
was sent to the Legislature. He finally removed to
Washington, D. C., where he still resides; he has
owned the homestead for many years. Silas, Jr., followed
civil engineering, went west and finally settled
on a farm near Grant City, Mo., where he now
resides.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE MELIUS HOUSE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Next in order stands the Esley Melius house. Old
deeds in the possession of Mr. Theo. Melius tell us that
on December 11, 1799, Abraham Van Emburgh and
Rhoda, his wife, sold to John P. Sandford for the sum
of $3.84, at a place called Belleville, a part of a water
lot, which the said Abraham Van Emburgh purchased
from Elisha Boudinot, Esqr., by a deed bearing date
November 12, 1799; this adjoined the lot “now conveyed”
to Charles Hedenburgh.</p>

<p class='c004'>March 20, 1866, John I. Sandford and Rhoda, his
wife; Asa Torry and Mary, his wife; Catherine Udall
and Sarah Hopson quitclaimed the above water lot
to Rachael Sandford, this being part of the real estate
of the late John P. Sandford.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_43'></a>March 20, 1860, Rachael Sandford deeded the
above water lot to Ezra Gould for the sum of $500.</p>

<p class='c004'>These transfers show the ownership of the waterfront
of the Melius place since 1799, and possibly some
time before that date.</p>

<p class='c004'>The north part of the present Melius house was
erected by John Stimis, probably at the same time
that he erected his own house, just above, 1805. Amos
Munn, son of Benjamin, of East Orange, and father
of Silas Munn, ancestor of the River road branch,
born 1763, died 1808, was at the time of his death
building a dwelling on the lot now occupied by the
Foster Home; his executors exchanged the unfinished
building for a two-acre lot, which is now part of the
Melius homestead. In 1811 the executors sold the
lot to Jean Baptiste Bacque. Later there dwelt here
one Hedenburgh, if I am correctly informed; then a
Vincent whose daughter, Dorcas, married Gilbert
Pullinger—the Pullinger reign lasted from 1830 to
1836. Mrs. Pullinger appears to have been a character
with more loves than come to most of us. After her
came the Duncans, a Zeiss, William Patterson, Ezra
Gould and Esley Melius.</p>

<p class='c004'>By a deed dated October 1, 1853, John R. Sked
and Sarah C., his wife, sold the property, which was
in shape like the letter L, and which inclosed on two
sides the property of Charles Daugherty, to Ezra
Gould, subject to several mortgages held by William
Patterson and others. And on May 1, 1857, Charles
Daugherty and Rachael, his wife, sold to Ezra Gould
<a id='Page_44'></a>a lot purchased in 1849 from William Patterson, which
squared the Gould property.</p>

<p class='c004'>April 12, 1866, Peter M. Myers and wife sold the
Ezra Gould property to Sarah A. Melius, wife of Esley
Melius, and the property has since remained in
the Melius family.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Melius was a daughter of Samuel Rust, the
inventor of the Washington press, which was the
foundation on which the great firm of R. Hoe &amp; Co.
was builded. The daughter received the best education
that the times afforded girls, being placed first at
a leading school in Poughkeepsie, then at the West
Point Academy on Lake Champlain, and was given a
finishing polish at Mrs. Jackson’s school on Broadway,
New York, which was located just above Prince street
on the site later occupied by the Metropolitan Hotel.
She was a woman of strong convictions and was in
her day a magazine writer of some note.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is a story current that Mrs. Melius once held
the Erie Railroad up at the point of her parasol by
standing in the middle of the track and shaking that
weapon at the approaching engine, which naturally
stopped all a-tremble, whereupon the lady climbed on
board a car and enjoyed a ride to New York. Just how
much of this is fact and how much is fancy is not altogether
clear at this distance.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>STIMIS FAMILY TRADITIONS.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The next house that can claim the dignity of age
is that built about 1805 by Mr. John Stimis, son of
<a id='Page_45'></a>Christopher, and occupied during our early days by
Col. Gilbert W. Cumming, and at present by the Andersons.</p>

<p class='c004'>Christopher Stimis was the first of the name to
settle in this neighborhood. He came some time before
the Revolution, from a place then known as
Weasel which, according to the Erskin Map No. 82
(made for the use of General Washington during the
Revolution), was situated along the Passaic river,
west side, some 3-4 miles north of the “Achquackhenonk”
bridge (the present town of Passaic).</p>

<p class='c004'>Christopher married a daughter of the house of
Coeyman and built his home, on land that had come
to his wife from her father’s estate, a few hundred feet
north of the present Melius house. When the Revolutionary
war came Christopher enlisted, and while
in the army took a heavy cold and died of hasty consumption.</p>

<p class='c004'>Christopher had two sons, John (1) and Henry (1).</p>

<p class='c004'>John (1) had five sons: John, Peter, Christopher,
Henry and William (the latter is the only one of this
generation now living).</p>

<p class='c004'>Henry (1), who lived in the old homestead just
south of John, had four sons: John, Abraham, James
and Thomas.</p>

<p class='c004'>The above information comes from Mr. William
Stimis, now 87 years of age, a grandson of Christopher.
His memory is clear and he is quite certain of
his facts.</p>

<p class='c004'>While the first Stimis did not keep a tavern in
<a id='Page_46'></a>the ordinary sense, he did know how to brew beer,
and for many years the house was a stopping place
for thirsty souls. Even as late as the Revolution the
brewing of beer was continued, for I am informed
that the place was frequented both by Hessians from
across the river and by such Continental soldiers as
happened in the neighborhood.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>HESSIANS BURY LOOT.</h4>
<p class='c006'>There is a story which has been handed down in
the Stimis family to the effect that some Hessians,
while on this side, were hard pressed by a superior
force of Americans, and in their haste to get away
were compelled to bury certain treasure or loot of
some sort in the field back of the Stimis house, toward
Washington avenue. This treasure has been dug for
within my own recollection, but so far as known was
never found. The Hessians also left behind in the
Stimis house some muskets and a camp kettle which
are still in the possession of members of the family.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>OLD TWO BOTTLES.</h4>
<p class='c006'>One of the characters of the River road some fifty
or more years ago was “General” James or “Old Two
Bottles”, as he was more familiarly known. General
James was a shoemaker who lived under the bank,
two hundred feet or so below the limekiln; in fact
at about the spot known to my youth as “the Cedars”,
where we boys learned to swim and had our clothes
tied in knots to a chant which, as I remember it, went
something like this:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_47'></a>“Chaw roast beef,</div>
      <div class='line'>The beef was tough;</div>
      <div class='line'>Poor little nigger,</div>
      <div class='line'>He couldn’t get enough.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>By wetting the article of clothing and pulling hard
two boys could draw tight a knot which took both
hands and all the teeth the owner of the aforementioned
article had to work loose.</p>

<p class='c004'>The General lived near the water’s edge in a little
hut of stone and wood. The old shanty leaked so that
when the rain fell he and his wife sought refuge under
the family umbrella, so the story goes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Near his house was a spring of good water, but
what interested the youth of the neighborhood more
was the legend of a cave close by where Captain Kidd
is said to have stowed treasure. This was supposed
to be at a spot where were more stones than nature
would seem properly to have gathered together, and
this the boys would now and then pry into, but so far
as known nothing came of it but an occasional backache.</p>

<p class='c004'>Presumably his close contact with the river bred
a contempt for water that became more and more
pronounced as the old fellow advanced in years,
when to the few who can now recall him he was a well
known character. Possibly he once drank some water
which did not agree with him—possibly he supposed
it was only intended for the floating of boats (none
has as yet made this point clear), but, whatever the
cause, our friend was very particular not to tamper
with his constitution by drinking any more of the
<a id='Page_48'></a>stuff. Hence the jug which was his constant companion
when visiting Newark.</p>

<p class='c004'>The General had a private path, just above the
reach of high tide, which came out on the main road
near the Point House, and every Saturday afternoon
wife Rachael and he would journey southward. They
always walked single file, the old lady some fifty to
one hundred feet in the rear—presumably this was to
insure the safety of the jug, a rear guard, as it were,
to protect the supplies, a precautionary measure which
would naturally occur to a military man.</p>

<p class='c004'>Possibly our “General” was a veteran of the war
with nature: that certainly is a satisfactory way to
account for his title. Just how he came by the secondary
title of “Old Two Bottles” is not quite clear,
but it is said that it was the result of high words in
the family. Mrs. General, it seems, longed for something
more substantial than the rear to guard, and appears
to have made an unwelcome suggestion that two
bottles would be better than one jug and, being some
distance behind the conversation was carried on
in an elevated tone of voice, and as the General’s rate
of locomotion was about a mile an hour the neighbors
came easily by the story.</p>

<p class='c004'>The General and his wife occupy unmarked graves
in the neglected burial ground above the Weiler house.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE ALEXANDER PLACE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The next house of which there is any memory was
a brick structure at the southwest corner of the River
<a id='Page_49'></a>and Division roads. This was the property of, and
presumably built by, “Jim” Alexander (James G.
Alexander?), who came from Newark and passed the
place many times as he drove the stage from Newark
to Belleville. Alexander was a North of Ireland man
who came to Belleville after a brief sojourn in Paterson.
For a time he drove a stage between Belleville
and New York, and also between Belleville and Newark.
He married a Coeyman and thus came into
possession of a farm which extended from Grafton
avenue south to the Henry Stimis place, and from the
river back to Summer avenue. He is said to have run
the limekiln at one time.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alexander’s house burned and he removed to
Belleville, where he became somewhat eccentric,
parading the streets barefoot and with a silk hat on
his head, in which costume he would preach whenever
the curious were willing to form a congregation.
There are stories current which indicate that he had a
ready wit and a tongue sharper than a two-edged
sword.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE LIME KILN.</h4>
<p class='c006'>We have come to the Division road, now Grafton
avenue, so far as this end of it is concerned. Opposite,
on the river bank, stood for many years the limekiln
erected by three Englishmen: Thomas Vernon,
Thomas Farrand and John T. Grice. This performed
its offices without doing serious damage to the landscape.
The last to burn lime here was Mr. Francis
Tompkins, but the old Newark Lime &amp; Cement Company
<a id='Page_50'></a>was finally too much for him, and he went under.
Between the burnings of lime there was little activity
about the place, and as time went on it became little
more than a picturesque wreck, and thirty years ago
or more the old kiln ceased work entirely. Then came
Mr. Benfield who, as some of his facetious neighbors
were fond of saying, had a process for extracting gold
from stone fences. So far as I have any knowledge of
the matter, the process was all right, but it cost more
to extract the gold than it would bring in the open
market, and so in a certain sense the experiment was
not a success, and it resulted in the erection of unsightly
buildings which have been added to from time
to time by others who would do things here, until
from being a picturesque ruin the place has grown to
be one of the ugliest sights on the river bank.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>HOUSES ABOVE GRAFTON AVENUE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Above Grafton avenue, on the corner, stood the
frame house of John McDonald, who married a Coeyman
(he was a calico printer by trade), and opposite,
between road and river, stood a small frame house occupied
by James Coeyman. Above, on the west, was
the brick house of Levi Coeyman, and next the frame
house of John DeHush Coeyman, while on the site
now occupied by the large brick house built by Peter
Weiler stood the home of Minard Coeyman, the hive
of the Coeymans. Just above, where the brook
crossed the road, was the house of Henry Coeyman,
and just beyond that of John Coeyman, later occupied
<a id='Page_51'></a>by William McDonald and by one Worthington. A
cannon ball and numerous Indian relics have been
ploughed up on this property. The last three buildings
were torn down by Mr. Weiler when he built
about 1860. The only other house below Second
river was the original Van Cortlandt stone house.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>COEYMAN GENEALOGY.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Peter Coeymans of Utrecht, in the Netherlands,
had seven children. His five sons sailed from Holland
in the ship Rensselaerswyck, October 1, 1636,
and settled in Albany, N. Y. The youngest of the
boys was Lucas Pieterse Coeymans. “May 14th, 9th
year of William 3d of England (1698) Leukes Coeman
of the towne of Newark yeoman”, bought of
Gerrit Hollaer of the city of New York, land lying on
the Passaic river, in the “toune” of Newark and
County of Essex, “where the said Leukes Coeman
now livith”. This deed was acknowledged January
17, 1699.</p>

<p class='c004'>The children of Lucas Peterse Coeymans and Arientie,
his wife, all of whom were born in Albany, N.
Y., were:—</p>

<p class='c004'>Geertie Koemans, who married Harmanus Bras,
October 5, 1695, at Hackensack.</p>

<p class='c004'>Marytie Koeymans, who married Cornelis Tomese,
August 8, 1696, at Hackensack.</p>

<p class='c004'>Johannes Koeymans, who married Rachel Symen
Van Winckle (of Acquackanonk), March 6, 1708, at
Hackensack.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_52'></a>Januetie Koemans, who married Gideon Symen
Van Winkle (of Acquackanonk), March 13, 1708.</p>

<p class='c004'>Very little has been preserved concerning the Coeyman
family, and probably the only way to trace the
line from Johannes down to Minard would be by a
long search of old titles. Minard Coeyman is said
to have served during the Revolution under Colonel
Van Cortlandt.</p>

<p class='c004'>Minard had sons: Henry M., Peter, William,
Thomas and John.</p>

<p class='c004'>Henry M. had a son, James A., whose son, Albert
J., now lives in Belleville.</p>

<p class='c004'>Peter had sons: Levi and Minard.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>EXTENT OF THE COEYMAN POSSESSIONS.</h4>
<p class='c006'>There is a legend in the Coeyman family to the
effect that it at one time owned all the land between
Second river and the Gully road, and that the land
purchased by Van Cortlandt was sold to him by a
Coeyman. That, if correct, would carry the property
north to Second river. Its southern boundary has
only been traced as far as the present Melius property.
Mr. William Stimis tells me that the first Christopher
Stimis who came here married a Coeyman, who received
as her portion of the estate six acres, which included
the land occupied by the late Henry Stimis
and extended to the present Melius property. Mr.
William Stimis thinks that his grandmother, the wife
of Christopher, above, was a daughter of Andrew
Coeyman and a sister of Minard Coeyman, but he is
<a id='Page_53'></a>not sure of this. Mr. Daniel F. Tompkins has made
the statement that the Coeyman property once extended
from the Gully road to Second river and westward
to include Forest Hill.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>A COEYMAN REMINISCENCE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>A Coeyman reminiscence tells how, in order to
save their bedding and household linen from the rapacity
of the soldiers it was placed on the barn floor
and covered deep with hay, and how the soldiers came
along and began to use up the hay and the pile went
down and down and down, until there were only four
feet between the invaders and discovery, but at this
point the troops left the locality and the bedding remained
in the family.</p>

<p class='c004'>The army lay on the Coeyman farm long enough
to cut down every forest tree that stood thereon, and
all the fine old trees that we knew thirty years ago
are said to have come into being since then. The
same story is told of General Wayne’s troops, who
camped along the Back road, and probably the above
refers to this same time.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>WASHINGTON MARCHES DOWN THE RIVER ROAD.</h4>
<p class='c006'>November 21, 1776, General Washington and the
troops from Fort Lee left Hackensack by the Pollifly
road, crossed over to the old Paramus road and
reached the bridge at Acquackanonk (now the town
of Passaic) about noon. Crossing there the bridge was
destroyed to delay the pursuing British under Cornwallis.
<a id='Page_54'></a>On the 22d Washington and 3,500 or more
troops left Acquackanonk for Newark. The forces
were divided, some going over the hill to Bloomfield,
the others keeping down the River road and thus entering
Newark.</p>

<p class='c004'>This was one of the most bitter periods of the
Revolutionary struggle; everything was apparently
going against the American cause, and it was a bedraggled
and disheartened company that marched
down our River road on that 22d day of November.
Thomas Paine participated in this retreat across
New Jersey, and it was this that inspired his “Crisis”,
which begins: “These are the times that try men’s
souls”, and it was at Newark on November 23d that
Washington wrote: “The situation of our affairs is
truly critical, and such as requires uncommon exertion
on our part.” The way in which Washington
handled this, as other desperate situations, has placed
him in the front rank of commanders the world over.
His “Fabian” policy of masterly inaction in front of
forces vastly superior to his own, combined with his
ability to recognize and take advantage of the opportunity
when it arrived, was marvelous.</p>

<p class='c004'>Cornwallis did not attempt to cross the river until
November 26th. Apparently he had no wish to
capture the American troops, as he spent something
like a week in the Passaic Valley, foraging on the
country as he went, and progressing in a most leisurely
manner.</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_55'></a>
  <h4 class='c008'>STEPHEN VAN CORTLANDT AT SECOND RIVER.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Stephen Van Cortlandt, twelfth child of Col. Stephanus
Van Cortlandt by his wife, Gertrude Schuyler,
was born 11, August, 1695; married 28, August, 1713,
Catalina Staats, daughter of Dr. Samuel Staats by his
first wife, Johanna Rynders. He resided at “Second
River” (now Belleville), Essex County, N. J. Issue:</p>

<p class='c004'>1. Johanna Van Cortlandt, born 3, February, 1714;
died without issue.</p>

<p class='c004'>2. Gertrude Van Cortlandt, born 23, February,
1715; married Johannes Van Rensselaer.</p>

<p class='c004'>3. Stephanus Van Cortlandt, born 19, September,
1716; died without issue.</p>

<p class='c004'>4. Samuel Van Cortlandt, born 22, December,
1717; died without issue.</p>

<p class='c004'>5. John Van Cortlandt, born 16, February, 1721;
died 29, June, 1786. Married Hester Bayard.</p>

<p class='c004'>6. Philip Van Cortlandt, born in 1725; died 1800
without issue. He commanded a New Jersey Regiment
in the Revolution.</p>

<p class='c004'>7. Sarah Van Cortlandt died without issue.</p>

<p class='c004'>John (above) had a son Stephen, born 11, August,
1750, and Stephen had two daughters—Elizabeth, who
married John Van Rensselaer, and Hester, who married
James Van Cortlandt. (The above is from Mrs.
Catharine T. R. Mathews, nee Van Cortlandt, an authority
on the family genealogy.)</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE OLD VAN CORTLANDT HOUSE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The old Van Cortlandt house, which is described
below, stood about midway between Second river and
<a id='Page_56'></a>the G. L. R. R. tracks, facing the Passaic, and also
the road, for at that time the highway kept very close
to the water’s edge but, owing to the frequent flooding
of this low land and consequent washouts, the
road was finally set back to its present line. Fifty
years ago this was known as the “new” road.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is some uncertainty as to when this house
was built, for if Dr. Staats gave the house now known
as the Belleville Hotel to his daughter at the time of
her marriage, as some think, Stephen Van Cortlandt
would hardly have erected a second dwelling, at least
until a son or daughter married and desired to
start a new establishment. During the later years of
its existence the old house is said to have been
haunted by a ghost nine feet high and hump-backed,
and the place had an uncanny reputation—misfortune
was said to follow its tenants. Old residents told of
skeletons in its musty closets, and one of the Van
Cortlandt family is said to have become insane while
living here, but what the tragedy was, if any, has not
been recorded.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>NOTES ON THE VAN CORTLANDT PLACE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Mr. Silas Munn says in his fragmentary diary that
when he moved into the old Van Cortlandt house
many people said that it was the abode of “hobgoblins”
and that ill fortune followed its occupants—then
followed the statement that at the end of two years
he was taken down with malarial fever—lost a flock of
sheep—two valuable horses, one of which was killed
<a id='Page_57'></a>by a foul with another on the road, and lost so much
money in his business that he was obliged to suspend
and take boarders. Bad luck seemed to follow all its
subsequent occupants till finally, in 1878, the old house
was destroyed by fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>The house was after the pattern of those built by
the Dutch farmers at an early day. A broad hall ran
through the centre, at either end were heavy doors,
divided horizontally, so that only one-half need be
opened at a time and thus leave the occupant free to
talk with a caller without intrusion. A broad garden
extended from the road to the house, a spacious barn
was nearby, while orchards of rare apples and pears
extended on either side and on the opposite side of
the road was another orchard of fine fruit. The property
in 1829 adjoined that of Minard Coeyman. It
was then known as the estate of Colonel Van Cortlandt.
Silas Munn, under date of September 2, 1829.
writes that he was requested by Minard Coeyman to
attend with G. Dow and fix the line between his land
and that of the estate of Van Cortlandt, when it was
found that the estate had inclosed 300 rods of Coeyman’s
land.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>ADVICE TO GIRLS WHO WOULD MARRY.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The first Mrs. John Van Rensselaer, who has been
heard by Mrs. Kay to say that she was married in the
house south of Second river, used to caution the
young girls of her acquaintance against too long delay
and overmuch prinking, and she was somewhat
fond of citing herself and her sister as examples.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_58'></a>It seems that when John Van Rensselaer came
down from Albany to spy out the land and its fair
daughters, he came to the Van Cortlandt house, where
the two girls were living, and word was brought upstairs
to the young ladies that the gentleman was below
awaiting them. Whereupon “Bess” was for going
down immediately, dressed as she was, but the
sister, thinking that a few more furbelows would add
to her charms, remained behind and spent a half hour
or so before the glass.</p>

<p class='c004'>This, of course, gave “Bess” an opportunity with
the visitor which she improved to such good purpose
that the matter of the future Mrs. Van Rensselaer
was practically settled by the time the much beautified
sister appeared on the scene. The story I have
from Mrs. Mary E. Tucker who, when a girl, was
told the incident by Mrs. Van Rensselaer herself.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>JOHN VAN RENSSELAER II.</h4>
<p class='c006'>About 1830 an Englishman named Duxbury was
living in the Van Cortlandt house. He had been
brought over to act as general superintendent of the
print works. John Van Rensselaer, whose father
married Elizabeth Van Cortlandt, became very much
interested in Margaret Duxbury, and they were
finally married. Thus two John Van Rensselaers in
succession went to the old house for their brides; the
children of John 2d were James, Cortlandt and Catherine.</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_59'></a>
  <h4 class='c008'>WHAT AN OLD MAP SHOWS.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>On the Erskin map No. 79, known as “From Newark,
through Acquackononk to Gothum” this house
is marked “storehouse”, while to the house north of
Second river (now the Belleville Hotel) is attached
the name of Stephen Van Cortlandt.</p>

<p class='c004'>This same map shows the old Coeyman house to
have been occupied by Hendrick Coeyman; another
house just north of this is not named, and these three
are the only houses noted on this map on the River
road between Second river and the Gully road, though
the old Stimis house must have been standing at this
time, and it is probable that the first King house was
also then in existence.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>CANNON BALLS FROM THE RIVER.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Mr. James S. Taylor tells me that in hauling for
shad on the reef just below Second river, which was
formerly only two feet under water at low tide, it was
no uncommon thing to scoop up occasional shells
from the bottom of a bigness of three to four inches
in diameter. The Decatur Powder Works were formerly
situated just above on the north bank of Second
river, and whether these shells were a relic of
that institution or were some reminiscence of the
Revolution no one seems to know.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>COEYMAN BURIAL GROUND.</h4>
<p class='c006'>But few of the stones are left in the old Coeyman
burial ground, which lies just north of the Weiler
house. The following is a complete list of those standing
at the present time:—</p>

<h4 class='c008'>INDIAN RELICS.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The New Jersey Historical Society has in its possession
two Indian stone hatchets and a number of
arrow points which were dug from the river bank 300
to 500 feet above Grafton avenue by Mr. William
Jackson. Indian relics have been dug up at numerous
points along the River road.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>A MYSTERY SOLVED.</h4>
<p class='c006'>About 1837 there was much mystery concerning a
certain “Button” factory on Second river, near the
Passaic, which was run by one Thomas Thomas.
Twice each year a vessel would ascend the Passaic
and drop anchor opposite Grafton avenue; no one
ever came ashore from her, and all sorts of rumors
<a id='Page_63'></a>were spread in regard to her. Some said she was a
smuggler, others a pirate. After nightfall there were
mysterious trips from the “Button” factory to the
schooner, men trundled heavy casks down to the water’s
edge and these were transferred to the vessel
which, in due time, sailed away with the awful secret
buried deep in her hold.</p>

<p class='c004'>It seems that Thomas was engaged in manufacturing
money which was sent to Brazil. Mr. William
Stimis, who ran the milling machine in the “Button”
factory states that copper coins of two sizes were
made. One marked “40” was the size of a silver half
dollar, and one marked “80” the size of a dollar. Jos.
Gardner was engaged to engrave the dies. The place
was raided two or three times on the theory that
counterfeiting was going on, and Gardner was arrested
at least once.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>ADDITIONAL ON THE VAN CORTLANDT HOME.</h4>
<p class='c006'>NOTE—The following was received from Mrs. Mathews too
late to insert it in its proper place. Mrs. Mathews
thinks that the house south of Second river was built by John
Van Cortlandt (5), son of the Stephen Van Cortlandt who married
Catalina Staats. It was his grand-daughter Elizabeth who
married John Van Rensselaer in the old house.</p>

<p class='c004'>NOTE—The inscription below was omitted from its proper
place in the list of those stones now standing in the Coeyman
burial ground:—</p>

    </div>

<div>
  <a id='Page_64'></a>
  <h3 class='c007'>DIVISION ROAD.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Division road, or Boot Leg lane, was merely a
cross road, connecting the River and Back roads. This
followed the present lines of Grafton avenue and Halleck
street with that bit of Washington avenue which
lies between, the jog being accounted for by a hill,
which it was necessary to circumvent.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first house built on the lane was that of James
Campbell, a silk printer by trade, who worked in the
factory of his brother, Peter, in Belleville. This was
situated at the foot of the hill in what is now the
northeast corner of Washington and Grafton avenues.
It was later occupied by Mr. Kennedy, the florist. The
next house was built by Mr. William Stimis (who
gives me these facts) about opposite the above on
Washington avenue.</p>

<p class='c004'>The third house erected was that of Mr. William
Tobey (Halleck street), an Englishman who was employed
in the Bird factory. Mr. Tobey is described
as a stocky man, genial, full of story and pleasant wit,
and he appears to be remembered as something of a
character. The place was added to by Morrison and
Briggs, and here Charles Morrison is said to have
lived for a time. Then came Mr. Stent, the architect,
<a id='Page_65'></a>who designed the present entrance to Mount Pleasant
Cemetery. The house is at present used for beer
bottling purposes. Halleck street was at one time
known as “Tobey’s” lane.</p>

<p class='c004'>The fourth house was that of Gilbert Stimis, on
the south side of Halleck street, and the fifth and last
until we come to modern times was the Edgecombe
house, erected about 1858. The family consisted of
the mother and three daughters. They are said to
have come here from Paramus.</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_66'></a>
  <h3 class='c009'>BACK ROAD.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Mrs. Charles Holt, who is 71 years of age, recalls
the time when the Phillips farmhouse was the only
house on the lower Back road, between the cemetery
and Elwood avenue, and when this stretch was known
as “Phillips’s lane”.</p>

<p class='c004'>As Mr. James S. Taylor remembers it, the only
houses along the old Back road, as far back perhaps
as 1850, were, beginning at the south:—</p>

<p class='c004'>First, the John C. Bennett house, built in 1852, at
the S. E. corner of Chester avenue; then, almost opposite,
the Miles I’Anson house, which now stands on
a knoll along the northern border of Chester avenue.
Next the Phillips homestead, on the west, just below
Delavan avenue, which has since been moved back to
Summer avenue. Above this there was no house until
the bend, now known as Elwood place, was passed.
Some distance beyond here stood a small stone house
on the right occupied by an Irishman. This was probably
Pat Brady, who in the fifties built just below the
present Bryant street. Pat had the reputation of
being a child of fortune. It is remembered that, while
very poor, he suddenly became well-to-do, and this
was only accounted for by the fact that he might have
<a id='Page_67'></a>“found a purse”. About opposite the Brady house
stood the “Magazine” house back in the field.</p>

<p class='c004'>Probably the next was the Thomas Coeyman (son
of William, who comes next) frame house, opposite
the Elliott street school. Then came the William
Coeyman house of stone, on the left and just above
the head of Halleck street. William Stimis states
that his father, John Stimis, worked on this house,
which was erected about one hundred years ago.
About half way between Irving street and Montclair
avenue stood the house of Peter Coeyman (Peter and
William were sons of Minard Coeyman of the River
road). Next was the Alexander house, a long, low,
story-and-a-half frame on the left just south of Verona
avenue. Following this was the Jesse Bennett
house on the S. W. corner of Verona avenue and opposite
this on a lane which probably ran to the River
road stood the Riddle house, formerly the J. F. King
house. Next the house of Benson, the miller, which
still stands at the S. E. corner of Summer and Sylvan
avenues. While still further afield, toward the rising
sun, stood the house of Jonathan Bird.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Back road, in a deed made in 1812, is called
the “Drift road”, while in 1820 it was “the road leading
from Garrit Houghwort’s to Captain Stout’s mill
‘dam’“ (present cemetery to Second river). Now this
highway of other days answers to three different
names: as Lincoln avenue, Elwood place and Summer
avenue. Mr. William Phillips has heard that in
1805 this road was merely a farm lane running not
<a id='Page_68'></a>further north than the present Elwood avenue; that
here it stopped at a farm, the owner of which would
not allow it to pass through his property, and presumably
this accounts for the turn at Elwood place,
it being a laudable effort to get around the obstructionist.
But, as will appear a bit later, General Anthony
Wayne marched up this road in 1779, and it
seems probable that the date, 1805, is too recent.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE “STRAWBERRY” LOT.</h4>
<p class='c006'>When we were boys the Back road began at the
“Strawberry” lot, a great ball field where the “Waverlys”,
the “Newark Amateurs” and others furnished
forth many a holiday. A member of the latter
was, I have heard, the first in this neighborhood
to pitch a curved ball which, in those days, was a
great event. Part of the “Strawberry” lot is still the
home of the athlete, for here the Riverside Athletic
Club reigned for many years.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>RIVERSIDE ATHLETIC CLUB.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Chronologically speaking the history of the Riverside
Athletic Club belongs to the second part of this
book, but this seems the best place to dwell briefly on
the subject.</p>

<p class='c004'>The club was organized about 1882, with some
twenty-five members, among the more prominent of
whom were L. P. Teller, William H. Brown, Paul E.
Heller, Henry W. Heller, Frank Cadiz, Edmund Pierson
and one Linehan. It was known as “the school
of the bowlers”, and turned out more good, successful
<a id='Page_69'></a>bowlers than any other athletic club in Newark;
in fact it almost immediately took a prominent place
in athletics generally, its track team was among the
best, it was successful in football and had a fine reputation
for square, manly sport.</p>

<p class='c004'>Starting without money, the members laid out the
grounds and built the track and tennis courts themselves,
but so popular did it become that within two
years there were something like three hundred members
and the club continued to thrive for many years.
Interest began to wane, however, as time went on,
and about five years ago the club disbanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>Shortly thereafter the Park Presbyterian Church
purchased the clubhouse, and it was turned over to
the Park Athletic Association, a church organization,
and is still so occupied, though I believe the association
is at present independent of the church.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>A MILLERITE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>On the slender point made by the opening of
Washington avenue stands the house erected by Mr.
Scharff, and which was the home of a Millerite in the
early days of Woodside, one Flavel by name, a baker
by trade. Whether working over the hot fires of the
bakery awoke in Mr. Flavel a desire to reach Heaven
before his time, or whether he was one of those uneasy
mortals who do not like to stay long in any one
place, has not been explained, but he was a Millerite,
that point is established. The neighbors still remember
how he used to adjourn to the roof, “in his nightgown”,
<a id='Page_70'></a>as one unsympathetic informant puts it, for
the purpose of being translated, but there was always
some hitch, and I believe he finally gave it up and
ultimately took the route that is open to all of us.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>NAMES OF SOME EARLY OWNERS.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The “Strawberry” lot belonged to Joseph West,
whose house stood, according to the map of 1849,
where Washington avenue now cuts into the brotherhood
of streets here. The old pump presided over
by “Mose” in the days of our youth, and from which
the street car horses were watered, was probably
the pump attached to the West house. This house
may have been built by Gerard Haugevort; it was
occupied by him probably 75 years ago. It was also
occupied, about 1845, by old “Mammy” Pullinger, who
started life on the River road, as a groggery and a
rather low resort. When Washington avenue was
cut through Mr. Nichols moved the building a few
hundred feet down the Gully road, where it stands to-day.</p>

<p class='c004'>Adjoining the West property on the north, and on
the west side of the Back road was a narrow strip of
land owned by Jesse Bennett, then came the Miles
I’Anson property, which extended to that owned by
John Morris Phillips, who also owned to the bend
in the road, now Elwood place—this on the left. On
the right the earliest map giving the names of owners,
and which is probably not older than 1865 shows, for
<a id='Page_71'></a>the same stretch, H. H. Nichols, John C. Bennett,
Stoutenburg &amp; Co., Romaine and Parker &amp; Keasbey.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>A LESSON IN MANNERS.</h4>
<p class='c006'>There is a story of one of the old residents here
who was not given to taking impudence from anyone,
particularly from those in his employ. He at one
time had an obstinate Irishman to deal with, and dealt
with him after the following fashion:—</p>

<p class='c004'>It seems that for some piece of impertinence our
citizen knocked his Irish employee down and jumped
on him, remarking as he did so: “I’ll teach you to be
a gentleman”, to which the under dog as promptly
responded, “I defy you”. Our friend soon had his
misguided opponent by the ears and was thumping
his face into the dirt with a right good will (“laddy-holing”
I believe this particular process is called),
and with each movement of his arms he repeated over
and over again his earnest desire to make a gentleman
of the Irishman, to which the latter continued vehemently
to respond, “I defy you! I defy you!”
Whether he succeeded in his laudable efforts is not
recorded, but he can at least be commended for his
zeal in the matter.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>MR. MILES I’ANSON AND PREVIOUS OWNERS OF HIS PROPERTY.</h4>
<p class='c006'>About 60 years ago a number of Englishmen
settled in the northern part of Newark. This immigration
was due to two causes: financial depression
in the mother country and the Chartist agitation,
<a id='Page_72'></a>1839-1848. Among those who came over at this time
was Mr. Miles I’Anson, who settled in the Woodside
district, where he purchased a farm of about 30 acres,
including the property south of the Phillips homestead,
extending about as far as the present May
street, on the west side of Lincoln avenue.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was Mr. I’Anson, it is said, who first suggested
the name of Woodside for this locality.</p>

<p class='c004'>A search of the I’Anson property made by Mr.
Daniel F. Tompkins for Mr. I’Anson contains many
interesting items and names, and is here quoted from
at length.</p>

<p class='c004'>By a deed dated December 10, 1812, Richard L.
Walker and wife sold the Back road property to Peter
Maverick. It is described as being located on the
“Drift” road, being bounded southeast on the Drift
road northeast by land now or late of David Phillips,
northeast (northwest?) and southwest by land now
or late belonging to Isaac Plume.</p>

<p class='c004'>Peter Maverick and his wife Mary on October 5,
1820, mortgaged to Hannah Spencer the above lot
and a lot beginning at the southeastern corner of John
Hawthorne’s lot on the western side of the “New
Road” (probably the Bloomfield turnpike and below
the Woodside line), leading from Garret Hogwart’s to
Francis King’s; thence on the eastern line of said
John Hawthorn’s lot of wood; thence to the northern
line of the lot of land belonging to the estate of Isaac
N. Kipp, dec’d; thence to the western line of said
“New Road”.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_73'></a>January 19, 1833, William Dow, Sheriff, sold to
Hannah Spencer the above two tracts of land.</p>

<p class='c004'>April 1, 1833, Hannah Spencer sold both of these
tracts to James Flintoff and George Flintoff.</p>

<p class='c004'>May 11, 1839, the administrators of James and
George Flintoff sold both tracts to William T.
Haines.</p>

<p class='c004'>January 5, 1842, William T. Haines sold the Lincoln
avenue lot to David Day.</p>

<p class='c004'>January 7, 1842, David Day and wife sold the
property to Miles I’Anson.</p>

<p class='c004'>November 19, 1841, William T. Haines and wife
sold to William Barnett a part of the tract (as supposed)
above referred to as situated on the western
side of the “New Road”.</p>

<p class='c004'>June 9, 1846, William Barnett and wife sold their
land to Miles I’Anson.</p>

<p class='c004'>April 7, 1803, the executors of Isaac Plume, deceased,
sold to John Hawthorne land at the northwest
side of “the Road or Drift Way Leading out of the
Public Road from Newark to Belleville”, thence east
to Ebenezer Smith’s land, thence north to David
Walker’s land, thence west to the road. (This is
copied as the search gave it.)</p>

<p class='c004'>September 14, 1822, Abraham Reynolds, Sheriff,
sold the same land to James Kearney, Esqr., except in
the 6th course “sold under Decree in Chancery, dated
April 2, 1822, wherein Gerard Haugwort (the various
spellings of this name follow those in the search; the
correct spelling is probably Haugevort), administrator
<a id='Page_74'></a>of Hester Sip, dec’d, is complainant, and John
Hawthorn and Margaret his wife, Aaron Munn and
Nathaniel Lindsley are defendants.”</p>

<p class='c004'>September 14, 1822, James Kearney sold to Gerard
Haughworth the same land last above.</p>

<p class='c004'>August 13, 1823, John Hawthorne quitclaimed to
Philip Kearney for all his interest in the last above
described land.</p>

<p class='c004'>The last will of John Hawthorne, dated August
18, 1841, and proved April 22, 1844, gives to John P.
Hawthorne the lot of land containing 14 acres, called
the Hogworth lot.</p>

<p class='c004'>April 1, 1845, Philip Kearney quitclaimed to John
Hawthorne for all his interest in the same land last
above described.</p>

<p class='c004'>March 28, 1845, John P. Hawthorne sold to Miles
I’Anson land beginning at a corner of the said Miles
I’Anson’s land on the west side of the Road leading
from Newark to the Belleville Paint Works; thence
south along said road, etc., the lot containing about
14 acres and bounded south, west and north by land
owned by Miles I’Anson.</p>

<p class='c004'>December 14, 1853, Miles I’Anson sold to Robert
Smith about an acre and a half, apparently to
straighten the latter’s line.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE PHILLIPS FARM.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Not so very many years ago, those who journeyed
back and forth to Belleville by way of the old “Back
road” passed the Phillips farm.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>The Phillips Farm House. Erected before the Revolution. Picture taken in 1869 shows one of the cherry trees that then lined the sidewalk.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>At the south end of the estate stood a quaint little
<a id='Page_75'></a>dwelling, bearing unmistakable marks of antiquity
upon its weather beaten boards and crumbling shingle
roof. This house had been the dwelling place of several
generations of the name.</p>

<p class='c004'>Colonel Phillips, the founder of the family in
America, was an officer in the English army under
Oliver Cromwell, and on the accession of Charles II.
to the throne of England, in 1660, he with others was
obliged to fly to America. He first settled in Killingworth
(now Clinton), Connecticut, and subsequently
removed to New Jersey, purchasing nine
hundred acres of land near Caldwell. One of his
grandsons, David Phillips, settled in Newark and married
Sarah Morris, grandaughter of a Doctor Morris,
who was also an officer under Cromwell, and who fled
to America with Colonel Phillips.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<a href='images/phillips-well-large.jpg'><img src='images/phillips-well.jpg' alt='The Old Phillips Well.' class='ig001' /></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>The Old Phillips Well. Said to date back to the time of the Indians.]</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>David Phillips had this property from Morris
Phillips, and he from Samuel Morris. David Phillips
began his housekeeping in the little house which stands
on the Lincoln avenue property, “purchasing 16 acres
of land for which his family received a deed from the
proprietors of East Jersey in 1696”, and here Morris
Phillips, the father of John Morris Phillips, was born
and here he died. This Morris Phillips was one of
the proprietors of the quarries at Belleville which furnished
the stone used in building Fort Lafayette, Castle
William on Governor’s Island, old St. John’s
Church in New York, which has recently been closed
by the Trinity corporation, and the old State House
in Albany.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_76'></a>The farm house still stands on the property,
though it has been moved back to Summer avenue in
the rear of the house erected some years ago by Mr.
John M. Phillips near the original homestead site.
The old farm had gradually acquired that human interest
which only comes of long tillage and close association
with man, its fine orchard of ancient apple
trees, the wood lot on the eastern slope of the hill
which lapped over into the Mount Prospect avenue
region, and which held for the man so many boy
memories of dog and gun, and the fertile flat lands
which stretched north along the old road. All these
combined to entice the man back to his boyhood’s
home, and it is small wonder that Mr. John M. Phillips,
who had a keen sense of the beauties and wonders
of nature, acquired the place for his own at the
first opportunity. Here was an ancient well of delicious
water, which tradition tells us was known to
and used by the Indians. Up to very recent times this
stood with its long well-sweep picturesquely adorning
the landscape.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>A REVOLUTIONARY INCIDENT.</h4>
<p class='c006'>In the winter of 1779 General Anthony Wayne
marched his troops up the Back road to the fields between
the present Elwood avenue and Second river,
where he went into camp. Mr. Frank Crane tells me
that when a boy it was a common thing to find along
this hillside, all the way to Second river, hollows in
the earth which are supposed to have been dug by the
soldiers for shelter.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_77'></a>Just about the time the troops reached the Phillips
farm, Mrs. Sarah, wife of David, mentioned
above, had finished a baking of bread; this she took
out and gave to the hungry soldiers with pretty much
everything else in the house that was eatable. It has
been handed down in the Phillips family, as elsewhere,
that the soldiers when they halted stood with
their feet in their caps to protect them from the snow—those
poor naked feet which had been cut and torn
by the sharp crust of the snow until they marked the
white highway with a trail of blood. The old grandmother
many times told the tale to the family gathered
about the warm hearth of the old farm house on
wintry nights, and the boy John never forgot it.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE PEROU TRACT.</h4>
<p class='c006'>A rather interesting tangle over the northern end
of the Phillips tract has taken much patience to unravel.
This concerned a small slice of land now
largely occupied by Phillips Park and Elwood avenue.</p>

<p class='c004'>About 1825 Benajah Perou purchased a certain
parcel of land from John Morris Keen, of which the
above was part. Perou was a seafaring man and, in
the spring of 1828, sailed for New Orleans, and nothing
was afterward heard from him. Being unmarried
his heirs were his six brothers and sisters, and in 1845
this property was divided amongst them, each receiving
a long narrow strip, 66 feet wide, fronting on the
“road from Newark to Belleville Paint Works”, and
running back into the sunset.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_78'></a>Daniel Perou received as his share the northernmost
strip, known as lot No. 6. He was living back in
the country and, in 1849, died intestate and unmarried;
thus his 66 foot strip fell to the five remaining brothers
and sisters, or their heirs, none of whom appear to
have paid any attention to the property. In the meantime
said brothers and sisters had been getting married
and having children, and these children had insisted
on growing up and doing likewise, until generations
arose who knew not that they were interested
in the property.</p>

<p class='c004'>Naomi Perou, one of the sisters of Benajah, married
Morris Phillips, and in due time became the
mother of John M. Phillips, who was one of the last
of the line to be born in the old farm house. And as
time went on and John M. prospered he began to buy
up the interests of others in the adjoining property
until he owned all of the Perou tract, or thought he
did. But by the time an attempt was made to definitely
fix the title to lot No. 6 there were found to be
more than three hundred shares into which this lot
must be divided, each one amounting to something
less than three inches in width, and extending from
Lincoln avenue to Mount Prospect.</p>

<p class='c004'>The hunt necessitated to clear this title led all over
the country. One heir was traced as far as New Orleans,
and lost; another vanished in the Civil War;
another moved to Mystic, Conn., and could not be
traced to his final end, and so it went. One was found
in Kansas and another in Western New York.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_79'></a>It cost more to perfect the title than the land was
worth, and when it was perfected the lot—or all that
was left of it—was given to the city for a park, a memorial
to the late John Morris Phillips.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE ANTHONY WAYNE CAMP GROUND.</h4>
<p class='c006'>It is family tradition among most of those whose
ancestors resided here during the Revolution that
Gen. Anthony Wayne camped along the old Back
road, but so far as can be ascertained the books are
silent on the subject. The New York Historical Society
can find nothing in its archives, and if the New
Jersey Historical Society has anything bearing on
this point it does not know it.</p>

<p class='c004'>The only mention of the event that I have been
able to find is an unsigned article which appeared in
the Daily Advertiser of December 12, 1884, which is
quoted here entire, as it contains much of interest.
The Advertiser says:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“The attention of an Advertiser reporter was recently
called to a tradition that Gen. Anthony
Wayne with 2,600 men was camped for a considerable
time during the severe winter of 1779 in the
vicinity of what is now Elwood avenue, and the old
Belleville road in this city. It was rather doubted
whether this could be possible, and all accounts of it
lost. Such an event would certainly have left an impression
which could not be entirely obliterated even
in a hundred years. From information obtained,
however, from the late John M. Phillips, whose
<a id='Page_80'></a>grandfather was a revolutionary soldier; William A.
Wauters, whose grandmother owned the woods in
which it is alleged Wayne camped, together with a
personal inspection of the ground made by Mr.
Daniel F. Tompkins, of Woodside, his son and the
writer, the following facts were ascertained:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“General Wayne, with a detachment of the American
Army, after the evacuation of New York, regained
for a portion of the winter encamped in the
Coeyman woods, in what is now Woodside. His
encampment extended from a point a little west of
and in line with the old Belleville road and north of
Elwood avenue, along the ridge up to Second river.
Traces of this encampment are found in the excavations
which the soldiers made for their huts. The
excavations are found also along the line of the
Montclair &amp; Greenwood Lake Railroad at the south
side of the bridge across the Second river. They are
found also on the side of the hill west of Mount
Prospect avenue, and south of the line of Elliott
street, and extending north several hundred yards,
the most marked being at the northern limit. In
one of these excavations the stones which marked
the temporary fireplace still remain. The troops cut
down the growing timber from these woods, and the
owner, Minard Coeyman, was paid for it by the government.
About half a mile northwest of this ridge
the old barn, in which were slaughtered the cattle for
the use of the army, still stands. It belongs to the
<a id='Page_81'></a>Crane family. Mr. Nathaniel Crane, who was born
in 1808, well remembers hearing his father and uncle
talk about the encampment. Wayne had several
field pieces with him, and the men used to take the
horses down to Second river to water at a point 100
yards from the railroad bridge, and near the ruins
of the old copper works, opposite Woodside Park.
In February Wayne moved his army to Morristown.
The close proximity of the British is given as the
cause of Wayne breaking camp. In his position at
Woodside he was liable to be flanked. Jasper King,
father of the late William King, of East Orange, was
a boy at the time Wayne was at Woodside, and his
father was a soldier in Wayne’s army. Jasper went
with his grandfather and his mother to say good-by
to his father at the encampment in Coeyman’s woods.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Jasper King related to the late John M. Phillips
that when the roll was called the soldiers came out
from their tents and some of them threw their caps
on the snow and stood on them with their bare feet.
He said it began to snow as the troops started on
their march to Morristown and some of the soldiers
left marks of blood on the snow as they marched.
Their way was along the old Bloomfield road, which
may have been reached by crossing the fields past
the old Crane Mansion, or by the way of Keen’s
lane, the outlines of which can still be traced southwest
to the Bloomfield road. From Bloomfield the
march was through Caldwell, where the snow became
<a id='Page_82'></a>so deep that the artillery was left behind and
remained imbedded in the drifts on a by-road near
where the penitentiary now stands, until spring. At
Bloomfield a picket was posted to guard the rear.
One of the men climbed onto the fence to see if the
British were pursuing. In the act his gun was discharged,
killing him instantly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The story of Jasper King is corroborated by the
known fact that on February 3, 1779, a snow storm
set in, which lasted three days, and the snow was
said to be eight feet deep on the Bloomfield road.
The inference that Wayne’s encampment at Woodside
was in the winter of 1779 is made more probable
from the fact that in his attack on Stony Point
in July, 1779, he had no artillery. That Wayne was
on the coast and near New York in the winter of
1779, is made exceedingly probable also by the following
letter from Lord Stirling, which if he had
been at Morristown with Washington would have
been directed to the Commander-in-Chief:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘Ramapogh, Jan. 5, 1779.—Dear Sir: From every
intelligence I have received I am induced to believe
that Count D’Estaing is on this coast; in consequence
of it I need not explain matters to you.
Notwithstanding my situation of body, I will be at
Paramis to-morrow and should be glad to see you
there as soon as possible, to concert every necessary
measure that may occur to us both.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘I am, D sir, your most ob’d sev’t.</div>
      <div class='line'>”‘Gen. Wayne.      STIRLING.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><a id='Page_83'></a>“That Wayne had artillery is evident from the
fact that Mr. Tompkins found a grape-shot on the
ground of the encampment. He also found a sword,
which, evidently, had been worn by a noncommissioned
officer.”</p>
<h4 class='c008'>A REVOLUTIONARY INCIDENT.</h4>
<p class='c006'>“During the winter of 1780-81 the British were at
Belleville and may have used the same encampment
previously occupied by the Americans. It is
known that they occupied ground near where the
new steel works of Dodge, Blake &amp; Lyon now are.
During this time a party of British stopped for the
night on Keen’s lane, mentioned before on what is
now Mr. Henry J. Winser’s lot, on Washington
avenue, opposite Carteret street. Another party
coming from Newark along the Passaic, stumbled
on the pickets of the first party and immediately
began firing. There was quite a skirmish in the
darkness before the true state of affairs was learned.”</p>
<h4 class='c008'>PHILLIPS FARM HOUSE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>“The old house in which the grandfather of the
late John M. Phillips lived stood flush with the old
Belleville road at the time of which we write, and
was visited frequently by the American officers. It
now stands in the rear of the new house on Lincoln
avenue, and is well preserved. A middle-aged Irish
woman came to the door at the knock of Mr. Tompkins
the other day and seemed inclined to deny an
inspection of the premises; but when it was made
<a id='Page_84'></a>known to her that the visit was to see the house
where the men who whipped the British a hundred
years ago had lodged, she accorded a right royal
welcome. A mere glance was sufficient to prove
that the house was not of modern date. There is no
plastering, and the joists that support the upper
floors are thick and strong and as substantial as
when put in, more than a hundred years ago.”</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE BRITISH ON WOODSIDE SOIL.</h4>
<p class='c006'>“While the British were encamped on this side of
Second river, near the steel works, the grandfather
of Mr. Tompkins, who was a scout in the American
Army and noted as an athlete, was reconnoitering,
with four companions, on the old Belleville road.
They accidentally came upon a picket post in the
dusk, the officer of which rode up and cried out:
‘Who you be for?’ Tompkins, to gain time, asked
the same question, ‘Who you be for?’ ‘For King
George’, said the English officer. ‘We be for the
Continental Congress’, shouted Tompkins as he
sprang into the woods. There was a fence that
stood in the way, and as Tompkins vaulted over it
the entire picket guard fired. Two of Tompkins’s
companions who, instead of jumping the fence had
climbed over it, were killed, but the former escaped
by the balls passing under him as he jumped. One
of the scouts who was killed on that occasion lies
buried in the old Bloomfield grave yard. The enemy
probably not knowing that they had killed any one,
left the bodies where they fell.”</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_85'></a>
  <h4 class='c008'>THE MAGAZINE HOUSE.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The march of improvement, in the opening of Woodside
avenue, has recently caused the destruction of
the “Magazine house”, a low stone building which
stood back of the present Summerfield M. E. Church.
This dated back to about 1812, when it was built for
the storing of powder made at the Decatur Powder
Works, which were located on the site of the present
De Witt Wire Works, Belleville. There was a spirit
of mystery and adventure about the place that somehow
tickled my boyish fancy greatly, and I always
passed it with a sense of adventure, but the above is all
that can be said of the spot. When Jacob Rutan was
building the calico print works on Second river he
lived here and his wife, Elizabeth, a member of the
King family, formerly of the River road, boarded the
men who were doing the mason work. How they all
slept in this small building is a mystery.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>EARLY LANES.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Just below the powder house; in fact, opposite the
point where Elwood place runs into Summer avenue,
the John Morris Keen lane led away to the Bloomfield
road. This, it appears, was part of a lane from
the River road, the easterly section of which was
known as the Stimis lane. Whether the latter was
opened for the purpose or, being established, was
merely used because convenient, has not been made
plain, but I am told that formerly a paper mill stood
on the Bloomfield road, and that the paper was made
<a id='Page_86'></a>from reeds gathered on the Hackensack meadows,
brought up the Passaic river, landed possibly at the
Point House landing and carted from there via the
two lanes to the mill.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE HAUNT OF THE HIGHWAYMAN.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The Back road, in the Elliott street neighborhood,
seventy-five or more years ago, entered a deep gully
surrounded on all sides by dense woods. It is possible
that this gave the early name of “Drift” road to
the highway, as it was a place into which snow could
easily drift and cause trouble to travelers. This was
a noted spot for highway robberies, many such having
occurred here, and the place was long dreaded by
those who were compelled to pass this way.</p>

<p class='c004'>The only actual hold-up of which I have heard is
said to have occurred in 1856, when four men who
came out of the woods from the direction of the
Magazine house attempted to rob a passing farmer.
What success they had I do not know, but it appears
that they were recognized and later arrested. One of
these, at least, was a Woodside man, but the names
of the others have been forgotten.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tom Coeyman built about sixty years ago at the
upper edge of this gully. His house stood near the
junction of Summer and Grafton avenues, and this
seems to have relieved the gloom of the place, for
so far as known there were no robberies after the one
mentioned above.</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_87'></a>
  <h4 class='c008'>NOT A CHRISTMAS CARROLL.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Probably before our time the Back road was the
dwelling place of “Owney” Carroll and his good wife
Peggy. Both were convivial souls, and each a character
in his or her way, but our most vivid memories
cling about the old lady. One old resident recalls that
in his youth the couple lived where now stands the
Elliott street school, and that one time when he was
passing with a load of wood Peggy was discovered
in a somewhat awkward predicament.</p>

<p class='c004'>It seems that one or the other—or possibly both—had
been looking on the wine when it was red, as was
their custom, and that the husband had concluded
that his better half would be improved by a bit of fresh
air and, having thrust her forth, locked the door.
Now Peggy does not appear to have taken this in good
part and, finding an open window, she proceeded to
crawl within; but, when about half-sill over, the sash
came down on her back and pinned her fast—just as
our informant was coming down the road with a load
of wood.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the course of years Mrs. Carroll became a sort
of attache of our back door, and I have a general
recollection that the old lady’s methods did not always
meet with the entire approval of my mother. She
certainly thoroughly disagreed with one of Peggy’s
capers. My mother was a great lover of plants, and
among her treasures was a lemon tree which actually
bore lemons; these Mrs. Carroll discovered one day
while cruising about the back yard and, carefully
<a id='Page_88'></a>gathering the treasured crop, she brought the fruit to
the back door and tried to sell it to my maternal ancestor.
Mrs. Carroll did not call at the house again
for some time.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE WOODS OF THE OLD BACK ROAD.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Those who sought knowledge at that fount known
as the Elliott street school, when it was but a country
schoolhouse, delight to recall how they were allowed
to roam the woods that then bordered the old
road on the west, for the first flowers of spring, and
how the schoolmaster would ring the bell from the
schoolhouse door summoning a return to study, and
the children would come scampering back with hands
full of bloom—windflowers and hepaticas mostly,
whose blue and white are so emblematic of the springtime
heavens. To those who can hark back so far
that patch of woods is remembered as a wonderfully
attractive spot.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>JESSE C. BENNETT.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Jesse C. Bennett came to this country from Stockport,
England, in 1833, to superintend the calico print
works, which lined the south side of Second river
from the Back road to the De Witt mill pond, and
he built a house at what is now the southwest corner
of Summer and Verona avenues.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Bennett was an Episcopalian, and as dancing
was one of the accomplishments of the day and
not barred by that creed, he engaged a master of the
art who once in so often gave the small Bennetts
(there were twelve of them) lessons in an addition
<a id='Page_89'></a>at the rear of the dwelling which provided a suitable
room. As time wore on Mr. Bennett became a Second
Adventist and turned this rear room from a dancing
hall to a place for prayer. One of the fervent brothers
of these times was Mr. Harry Harvey, who was given
to long prayers; in fact he thought nothing of praying
for an hour at a stretch. For these exercises the children
were brought in and ranged under the long mantelpiece
on one side of the room, but an hour was a
long time to be good in those days, and generally one
or two or three would steal awhile away without being
noticed. This gradually emboldened the others,
and one time while the heads of the elders were bowed
in devotion the entire youthful congregation managed
to get out unnoticed, and there was considerable
commotion when the fact was discovered and, as I
understand it, the commotion was not entirely confined
to the elders.</p>

<p class='c004'>Later Mr. Bennett became a Methodist and joined
the church of that denomination in Belleville.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Bennett once had a man working about the
place who was fresh from the Emerald Isle and he,
venturing out one evening shortly after his arrival,
came running back a badly scared Irishman, and announced
that the woods were full of fairies, for he had
seen their lanterns. It proved to be his first acquaintance
with fireflies.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE CALICO PRINT WORKS.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The calico print works which lined the south bank
of the Second river from the Back road to the De
<a id='Page_90'></a>Witt mill pond developed into a large industry under
Messrs. George and Jonathan Bird. This part of the
river bank has been a mill site for more than one
hundred years.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first on record was the grist mill of Captain
Bennett. His mill was a small affair which stood on
the bank where the Back road crossed. Next came a
Captain Stout, who rebuilt the mill. Both of these
lived in the dwelling later known as the “Bird” house.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<a href='images/bird-house-large.jpg'><img src='images/bird-house.jpg' alt='The Bird House, Sylvan Avenue.' class='ig001' /></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>The “Bird” House, Sylvan Avenue. Legend has it that this was built by an Englishman who was compelled to leave the country when the Revolutionary war broke out.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>About 1824 the Stout mill and lands were sold to
the Eagle Printing Company, which erected a large
factory for the printing of calicoes along the south
bank of Second river, extending from the Back road
to the De Witt mill pond. The concern employed
several hundred hands and conducted a business of
great magnitude for those times, but it finally fell on
evil days and failed about 1855.</p>

<p class='c004'>At this time the Back road was so narrow that
wagons could hardly pass; indeed, so much of a country
lane was it that even as late as 1850 the passing
of a load of calicoes from the mill was an event to
call the few inhabitants to the windows to see the
sight.</p>

<p class='c004'>After this Andrew Gray and one Wright successfully
conducted the business for some time, and
finally George and Jonathan Bird became the proprietors.
Jonathan Bird lived in the stone house that
has since been known as the “Bird” house, and here
dispensed a hospitality that was famed for many a
mile around. In due course George Bird died, and
<a id='Page_91'></a>later Jonathan sold to a stock company, of which
John Eastwood was a member. This company put in
some expensive machinery but, owing to internal
strife, the business was abandoned after a brief existence.</p>

<p class='c004'>After remaining idle for some time the hat manufacturing
concern of Moore &amp; Seeley purchased the
buildings, but before they did much the factory
burned, and was never rebuilt. The story given out
to account for the fire was to the effect that it was
due to Chinese cheap labor. According to this version
the hatters introduced Chinamen and the Irish
element, which predominated at the time, objected,
and the fire gave point to their objections, but there
are some still living who account for the fire in a
wholly different way.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>A FLESH AND BLOOD GHOST.</h4>
<p class='c006'>There was a time when the Back road bridge
across Second river was haunted by a headless ghost—at
least I am so informed—but it seems that when
off duty the ghost was known as old Sam Adams’s
daughter, Mary Ann.</p>

<p class='c004'>When I was a boy the ruins of the old grist mill
still stood close to the southeast corner of this bridge.
It was then known as Benson’s mill, a man of that
name having been the last miller. Some time some
one was either murdered and thrown into the mill
race here, or else was accidentally drowned. In either
case the situation furnished the proper material for
a mystery, and it would appear that there was talk of
<a id='Page_92'></a>an apparition having been seen on the bridge shortly
after the occurrence.</p>

<p class='c004'>This was taken advantage of by Mary Ann Adams
to frighten the boys, and as a result few people cared
to cross the bridge after dark, as too many had actually
seen the ghost to leave any doubt of its existence.
This, of course, was long ago, when Mary Ann
was young. She died some six years ago, an old
woman.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>WASHINGTON RESTS AT SECOND RIVER.</h4>
<p class='c006'>There is a legend that Washington once rested at
the grist mill, and that here his troopers purchased
feed for their horses. This was probably during the
retreat from Fort Lee.</p>

<p class='c004'>Somewhat south of the mill stood the miller’s
house; in fact the building is still standing on its
old foundations, at the southeast corner of Summer
and Sylvan avenues. Here was born Col. Henry Benson,
whose accidental death at Malvern Hill during
the Civil War furnished Belleville with its first military
funeral.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>THE OLD BLOOMFIELD ROAD.</h3>
</div>
<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<a href='images/bloomfield-road-large.jpg'><img src='images/bloomfield-road.jpg' alt='The Old Bloomfield Road in 1903.' class='ig001' /></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>The Old Bloomfield Road in 1903. Looking north to houses at the corner of Clifton and Berkley Avenues. This part of the old road is now obliterated. Those who laid out this hill top had no appreciation of the fact that a crooked road is a line of beauty, both this and Murphy’s Lane having been suppressed in favor of a series of right angles. What would New York above 59th street be if the curves of Broadway were straightened?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The old Bloomfield or Long Hill road is frequently
spoken of by the older inhabitants as a former
Indian trail “from the mountain to the river”.
This may have been one of the many paths which intersected
the great Minisink trail extending from the
Shrewsbury river to Minisink Island, in the Delaware
river below Port Jervis, where the council fires of the
Leni Lenape constantly burned. This particular
branch probably passed through Great Notch on the
First mountain, meeting the main path near Little
Falls.</p>

<p class='c004'>The white man’s road began where what is now
Second avenue joins Belleville avenue, and labored
up the grade to the present Prospect place, where it
turned toward the north for Bloomfield. The old
road is less prolific in story and incident than any
other part of this region. Those interviewed have invariably
wished that I might be able to talk with
some one now gone who was full of ancient lore, but
as dead men tell no tales I have found myself at a
disadvantage.</p>

<p class='c004'>Not only have the inhabitants gone, but the old
road itself is largely a memory, for those who are now
<a id='Page_94'></a>exploiting this region have almost obliterated the
former highway, finding that its meandering course
interfered with their straight lines, and not having
in mind the attraction that a bend in the road, the
curving line of beauty, with its mystery of a fair, unknown
country beyond, has for the stroller.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>LORENZO DOW.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Along this road during the early days of the last
century passed the eccentric preacher Lorenzo Dow,
on his way to the little Methodist church beyond Sunfish
pond. Dow was an occasional visitor in the
vicinity and left a memory of peculiar sayings and
doings that flavored the local gossip for the better
part of a hundred years. It is said that a toll-gate
once stood near the canal bridge, which was kept by
Archibald Jacobus, and those who were boys when I
went skating on Sunfish pond will recall the ruins of
an ancient grist mill whose wheel was turned by the
waters of the pond. Concerning this Mr. Walter S.
Nichols remembers when a boy making regular journeys
to this mill with a grist of corn for the grinding—this
was in the fifties, after the Searing mill on the
canal had been abandoned.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE OLD ROAD A HIGHWAY.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Until the toll-gates were removed, some twenty-five
or more years ago, from the Turnpike or “New”
road, as the present Bloomfield avenue was called, the
old road was the avenue for pleasure driving and also
for much heavy traffic between Newark and Bloomfield.
<a id='Page_95'></a>This made the highway of prime importance
and may help to explain the inflated values set on land
in this region before the panic of ’73.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>ADRIAN SCHARFF.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The Adrian Scharff house, which stood just within
the Woodside line, was erected some time before 1850.
It seems that Mr. Scharff brought his old world ideas
with him to this country and thought he must either
have a river frontage for his home or a view. He had
almost decided on the site now occupied by the Mount
Pleasant Cemetery, but finding that that was not
available, contented himself with the next best spot
near the hilltop.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE “WHITE-HOUSE” SMITHS.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Beyond the Scharff house the road ran through
dense woods for a short half mile to the Robert
Smith property—known as “White-house” Smith to
distinguish him from “Brick-house” Smith further
north. The records show that this property was sold
by Thomas Saffin to Thomas Havens, and by him to
Ebenezer Smith. When this house was built is not
known, but probably it was erected by Ebenezer
Smith, father of Robert.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ebenezer Smith, born February 24, 1791, who was
one of a large family, was the son of Scotch parents
who immigrated to this country before his birth.
Ebenezer had two sons, Robert and Ebenezer, Jr., and
one daughter. Robert fell heir to the “White-house”
Smith property. Ebenezer, Jr., married a daughter of
<a id='Page_96'></a>Matthias Baker, and thus came into the property on
which his son, Matthias Smith, erected the home of
the “Brick-house” Smiths. Ebenezer, Jr., had two sons,
Robert (2) and Matthias. Robert (1) lived in New
York and used this as a summer home; he died in
1858. Robert Smith was a lover of fast horses and
was in the habit of driving from Jersey City to his
home. He had one horse, of which he was particularly
proud, that would cover the distance in an hour.</p>

<p class='c004'>In those days the Hackensack meadows were covered
with a dense cedar growth which was a hiding
place for those whose deeds were evil, and the road
was the scene of many hold-ups. On one occasion Mr.
Smith, while driving home, overtook a woman who
asked for a ride, and he took her in his trap, only to
discover that the supposed woman wore heavy boots;
he then concluded that they would later meet with
others who would assist in relieving him of the necessity
of carrying his money home. Having made up
his mind to rid himself of the passenger, he dropped
his whip and requested her to get it, as he could not
leave his restive horse; and, of course, once she was
out, he did not wait for whip or passenger.</p>

<p class='c004'>The children of Robert Smith all of whom are now
dead, were Charles H., Eugene B., Robert A., Sarah
and Agnes W.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>LAND VALUES BEFORE THE PANIC OF ’73.</h4>
<p class='c006'>This property was purchased by Peter H. and
John H. Ballantine just before the panic of 1873 (the
deed is dated January 31, 1873) when prices were
<a id='Page_97'></a>greatly inflated, and they paid therefor the sum of
$217,000, paying $50,000 down and giving a mortgage
and bond for the remainder. It was not long before
the new purchasers saw the error of their ways and
desired to relinquish the property and the $50,000,
but to this the Smith estate would not agree. It is
hardly probable that they will ever see a profit on the
investment, as interest at 5 per cent (and it was more
than five in those days) would in itself now amount
to almost twice the original outlay, and when the
taxes and assessments to which the property has
fallen heir are added to the loss of interest, even eighty
dollars a foot can hardly seem a large sum to the Ballantine
estate.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>WHERE JOHN MORRIS LIVED.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Passing the Robert Smith place we come to the
home of the Bartholfs, which was erected more than
sixty years ago, as it is so designated on the map of
’49. Who Mr. Bartholf was or where he came from
I have not ascertained. The records show that John
G. Bartholf purchased the property from Samuel
Morris, who had it from Zebulon Morris, to whom it
came from John Morris. This was probably that
John Morris who was a resident of the old Bloomfield
road during the Revolution.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. John Morris Phillips, in the Daily Advertiser
of February 19, 1880, stated that John Morris was his
great-grandfather, and that it was to his house that
the son of Joseph Hedden came when he fled from the
British (referred to elsewhere), having nothing on
<a id='Page_98'></a>but his night clothes and a pair of stockings. His
feet were frozen to the bone as a result of the exposure.</p>

<p class='c004'>Some time in the sixties Mr. Albert Beach acquired
this property which he at first used only as a
summer home. The house was taken down in November,
1909.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>KEEN FAMILY TRADITION.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The Keen homestead adjoined the Beach property
on the north. Just when the farm house was erected
is not known, but that it is pre-Revolutionary there is
no question.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<a href='images/keen-house-large.jpg'><img src='images/keen-house.jpg' alt='The Keen Farm House.' class='ig001' /></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>The Keen Farm House. Pre-Revolutionary. This shows the building as it stands to-day.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>In 1765 Thomas Keen, a native of England, and
Miss Clorinda Lake, of Holland, were married on
Long Island, and subsequently settled at Belleville,
Essex County, New Jersey.</p>

<p class='c004'>Their son, Joseph Lake Keen, was married to Abigail
Morris in 1790.</p>

<p class='c004'>Their son, John Morris Keen, was married to
Peninah Sanford in 1820.</p>

<p class='c004'>Their son, Zebulon Morris Keen, was married to
Hanna Maria Garrabrant in 1863.</p>

<p class='c004'>Their surviving son, John Morris Keen, was married
in 1908 to Helen Virginia Brainard.</p>

<p class='c004'>The grandfather of the present John M. Keen was
born in 1797, and Peninah Sanford was born in Kearney
(New Barbadoes) in 1792. She was a descendant
of Capt. William Sanford, mentioned elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Keen homestead still remains, the house being
substantially unchanged, but the barns, cribs and
<a id='Page_99'></a>smoke house have long since been removed. Pear
trees standing in the yard over twenty years ago were
said by Mrs. Peninah Keen to be over two hundred
years old. This same grandmother, who began life
in 1792, has stated that Washington, in one of his
journeys to and fro, came up the old Keen lane and
stopped at the farm house for a glass of water. This
lane has been in use for at least one hundred and fifty
years, as seventy-five years ago trees lined its borders
which were then not less than seventy-five years old.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE “BRICK-HOUSE” SMITHS.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Almost opposite the Keen home lived the “Brick-house”
Smiths. This building was erected fifty-three
or fifty-four years ago by Matthias Smith on the site
where formerly dwelt his maternal grandfather, Matthias
Baker. The latter had the property from Isaac
Soverhill.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE SIDMANS OF OTHER DAYS.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The Sidman family dates back to the time of
William the Conqueror, when the first ancestor of
whom there is any record is said to have come to
England from Normandy. He appears to have been a
favorite of the great William and received from him
a considerable grant of land on the river Syd and
from this the family derived its name—Sydenham,
which was later shortened to Sidman.</p>

<p class='c004'>The introduction of the Sidman family to this
neighborhood began with a romance, when John Sydenham
ran away with Susannah Handcock, in 1711.
It seems that Edward Handcock, “yoeman” (or
<a id='Page_100'></a>Handcook, as one document gives the name) was living
on this property in the year above mentioned, and
that John Sydenham, who happened along from no
one knows just where, fell desperately in love with
Susannah, an only daughter, but the stern father
frowned on the young man’s suit and Susannah was
locked in an upper room.</p>

<p class='c004'>However, John brought around a ladder one night,
and the two adjourned to the parson. That they were
promptly forgiven is evidenced by the following extract
from a deed, made in 1711 by Edward Handcock,
in which he says: “for and in consideration of
the love, good will and affection which I have and
do bear unto my loving son-in-law, John Sydenham,
etc., and my only daughter, Susannah, his wife”.
He then deeds to his son-in-law four acres of his land
situated on the “highway to Acquacanong”, and six
acres on the “highway to Watersson”, which latter adjoined
land owned by Jasper Crane and by John
Godon.</p>

<p class='c004'>The following genealogy of the family is furnished
by Miss Laura M. Sydenham of Plainfield, and is
taken largely from the family Bible:—</p>

<p class='c004'>John Sydenham (1) married Susannah Handcock,
1711. They had issue: John (2), born March 16,
1714; died in 1754. Samuel, who died intestate and
unmarried in 1759. There is some doubt about this
Samuel, there being but slight mention of him in the
records, but it is presumed that he was the son of
John Sydenham (1).</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_101'></a>John Sydenham (2) married Martha Longworth,
December 8, 1741. They had issue:—</p>

<p class='c014'>Dorcas, born November 30, 1742.</p>

<p class='c016'>David, born October 11, 1744.</p>

<p class='c016'>William (1), born July 8, 1746.</p>

<p class='c016'>John (3), born May 10, 1748. He removed to
parts unknown on the upper Hudson river,
and nothing further has been learned concerning
him.</p>

<p class='c016'>Susannah, born February 15, 1750.</p>

<p class='c016'>William (2), born November 15, 1751.</p>

<p class='c016'>Thomas, born November 4, 1753; died August
12, 1816.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thomas Sydenham married Sarah Fordham, in
October, 1779. They had issue:—</p>

<p class='c014'>Susannah, born 1780; died 1852.</p>

<p class='c016'>Martha, born 1783.</p>

<p class='c016'>John (4), born 1785; died 1859.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mary, born 1788.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sarah, born 1791; died 1831.</p>

<p class='c016'>David, born 1795; died 1822.</p>

<p class='c016'>Bethiah, born 1798; died 1844.</p>

<p class='c012'>John Sydenham (4) married Amelia, daughter of
Matthias Baker, August, 1817. They had issue:
Mary E., Martha A., Albert T., Sarah E., John E.,
Matilda L., Harriet and Julia.</p>

<p class='c004'>John Sydenham (2) married Martha Longworth,
as stated above; she was born August 23, 1724, and
died May 12, 1804. Her sister Mary (born April 22,
1737, died September, 1793) married a Mr. Eckley.
<a id='Page_102'></a>The sisters both resided in the Sidman house now
standing. One Isaac Longworth, who owned a store
in New York in 1759, and was the owner of a sloop
which traded up the Passaic river, is believed to be
the father of Mary and Martha, and also of a son
Nicholas, who removed west to Cincinnati, and became
the progenitor of that branch of the family.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>The Sidman (Sydenham) Homestead. Date of erection not known. Picture taken in 1909.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The house now standing is not the Hancock house
of 1711, though it is known to be more than one hundred
and fifty years old. The Dutch oven, where
bread and pies were formerly baked, is still a part of
the structure, and the long-handled, wooden shovel,
used to remove those edibles when baked, is still a
part of its furnishings.</p>

<p class='c004'>The present spelling of the name Sidman has been
in occasional use for at least one hundred and fifty
years, as the name is so spelled in the grave-digger’s
bill for John (2), who died in 1754. In the paper detailing
the settlement of the estate of John (2) the
name is spelled Sidnham. In an inventory of his
goods is mentioned “Hagar, a negro girl”, who was
valued at £40. In a document dated in 1816 the name
is spelled Sidingham. The present spelling came into
general use with David, son of Thomas, who refused
to sign his name other than Sidman.</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Laura M. Sydenham tells me that when she
was a child a certain hollow on the crown of the ridge
which had the appearance of having been surrounded
by a heavy stone wall, and which was situated in the
fields, she thinks, somewhere between the house of
<a id='Page_103'></a>Mr. Elias G. Heller and the Presbyterian church, was
pointed out by the elders as the site of a fort erected
for protection against the Indians, but nothing more
definite than this is known.</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Sydenham also remembers having been told
that a Tory, whose house was burned because of his
unpatriotic tendencies, resided between the present
Sidman house and Murphy’s lane.</p>

<p class='c004'>The woods on the Sidman place were used to some
extent as a camping ground by certain Indians. Miss
J. A. Sidman recalls having heard her grandmother
tell of an invitation extended to her by these Indians
to dine with them and, as she preferred not to offend
the red-skinned neighbors, the invitation was accepted;
but this proved to be one of the times when
a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, for she arrived
in time to see the dinner preparing and the
careless and uncleanly methods of her hosts so nauseated
her that she invented some excuse and came
away.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another of the early memories is Mollie, an old
Indian basket maker, who frequented the neighborhood,
securing her material from the Sidman woods.
She frequently slept on the floor of the kitchen, always
in a sitting posture. One day other Indians
came this way and the wild instinct returned to the
old basket maker who, after an excited conversation
with her new-found friends, departed with them never
to be seen again in the neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c004'>The upper end of Branch Brook park, which was
<a id='Page_104'></a>formerly a part of the Sidman domain, was known as
“Blue Jay” woods.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>FOREST HILL BEFORE MORRISTOWN.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Some years before his death Mr. Daniel F. Tompkins
called at the Sidman house and made the statement
that he had found in New York a document
which contained information to the effect that Washington
contemplated establishing his winter camp at
“Sidman’s (Sydenham’s) Clove”, but owing to its
proximity to the British lines the idea was abandoned
and instead he fixed the camp at Morristown. Mr.
Tompkins believed that this referred to this Sidman
property which then covered a considerable tract, but
no member of the family had ever heard any part of
the estate called the clove, and nothing further was developed.
A brief search among the records of the
New York Historical Society fails to reveal the source
of Mr. Tompkins’s information.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>A KEEN HOMESTEAD.</h4>
<p class='c006'>On the corner of the old road and Murphy’s lane
stands another Keen homestead. The original house,
which has been added to until it has lost much of
its identity, was part of the Crane estate and came
into the Keen family through the marriage of Alfred
Keen with a sister of Nathaniel J. Crane. The older
part of the house was probably built a hundred years
ago. The front part was erected by Alfred Keen
about fifty years ago.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE FARRAND FAMILY.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The old Moses Farrand home formerly joined the
<a id='Page_105'></a>Keen property, extending to the canal. The building
was torn down some years ago. It was a fine old
place in its day, having been erected, it is said, near
the close of the eighteenth century. The rooms were
spacious for those days, while a great central hall extended
from front to rear. The walls were thick and
massive, the brown stone of which they were constructed
is supposed to have been taken from the
quarry at Soho.</p>

<p class='c004'>Dr. Edward D. Griffin pastor of the First Presbyterian
Church of Newark from 1801 to 1809, was in
the habit of riding out to this house to conduct religious
services for those living in the neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c004'>The family record in the old Farrand Bible, now
in possession of Miss Anna B. Farrand, begins with
Moses, who was born in October, 1728, and died September
19, 1805; following him comes Samuel, born
July 25, 1759, died December 26, 1826; he married
Sarah Andruss, who was born December 30, 1769, and
died in June, 1874; Joseph,
born January 10, 1792; Moses Andruss (2d), born
October 11, 1793, died January 26, 1862; Rachael,
born August 13, 1795, died August 19, 1816; Sarah
Ann, born August 4, 1797; Charles, born July 29, 1799,
died in June, 1874; Joseph, born December 20, 1801,
died August 19, 1830; Phœbe, born November 23,
1802; Samuel Edward, born June 2, 1803; John Herman,
born June 2, 1805, and Samuel Edward (2d),
born May 19, 1807.</p>

<p class='c004'>The oldest Farrand home in this region was situated
<a id='Page_106'></a>on our old road, but across the line in Bloomfield.
Here Washington is said to have been a guest.
This property fell to Charles, father of Miss Anna B.,
who has given me most of the family history.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Farrands, name originally spelled Ferrant,
were Huguenots, and presumably were part of the
emigrants who left France owing to the Revocation of
the Edict of Nantes, following which several hundred
thousand Frenchmen were compelled to seek refuge
in other lands. A considerable colony of these settled
in the neighborhood of New York during the early
part of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is nothing further of interest concerning the
old Bloomfield road; the short stretch beyond the
canal which lies within the confines of Woodside offers
no discoverable history or legend that may be used
for this sketch.</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_107'></a>
  <h3 class='c009'>MURPHY’S LANE.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The Lower Road From Belleville to Bloomfield.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE VAN RIPER FLOWER GARDEN.</h4>
<p class='c006'>One who knew Murphy’s lane in years gone by
would naturally begin with Charlie Van Riper’s
flower garden. When we were young, Charlie Van
Riper lived in a frame house, the northern windows of
which overlooked Second river. The foreground of
his view was a neglected expanse through which meandered
Murphy’s lane, and also a second cart track
which, as I recall it, merely shortened the distance a
few feet for those seeking “Murphytown” from the
south. This cart track, which is now Sylvan avenue,
west of Summer avenue, ran close by the old-fashioned
flower garden, which Charlie knew so well how to
encourage to do its best, with its marigolds and hollyhocks,
and all the old friends set out in little odd-shaped
beds bordered with box. Charlie was as generous
with his flowers as his flowers were generous to
him, and many a child who stopped to gaze through
the picket fence into that wonderland of gorgeous
color went on his way with a bunch of blossoms given
to him by the kind old soul.</p>

<p class='c004'>That portion of the wild land which was not interfered
<a id='Page_108'></a>with by the traffic of Murphy’s lane offered inducements
to the youngsters that I am inclined to
think they rather preferred to the Van Riper flowers,
and these were the hazel bushes which grew in abundance,
the ripened fruit of which was a great attraction.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>BIRD’S WOODS.</h4>
<p class='c006'>“Bird’s Woods”, where “The slant yellow beam
down the wood-aisle doth seem like a lane into
Heaven that leads from a dream”, should have had a
Sidney Lanier to immortalize its cool and delicious
depths. It was the picnic resort of many a Sunday
school, but picnics in the early days were simple affairs
and did not call for changes that seriously
marred the beauty of the forest. The growth was almost
wholly pine and hemlock, and the balsam-laden
air is refreshing even yet to think of. A few swings
and a sheltered platform, where lunch was served,
were the only attempts of man to improve on the situation.</p>

<p class='c004'>Second river with its babbling waters, the ruins of
the old paint mill, and the old dam, with its waterfall
at the woods’ end, all combined with the forest to lend
enchantment and to a child furnished possibilities for
entertainment that were inexhaustible. How well I
remember the rush of small feet when the Sunday
school children reached the entrance to the woods,
and how they spread out like a fan through its coverts
of mystery, each one intent on finding something new
or re-discovering some old friendly spot.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_109'></a>Then the woods were full of sound, and I can still
recall the infectious laugh of Mr. Hine, who, as superintendent
of the school and chief promoter of jollity,
urged the children on to a full enjoyment of the
occasion and his call to a stray robin that might at the
moment be voicing his approval of the place, “That’s
right, old fellow. Go it!” and then he would whistle
to the bird in the tree in a way that started him all
over again. We will never see the like of “Bird’s
Woods” again.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>NAMES OF FORMER DWELLERS ON MURPHY’S LANE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>As nearly as can now be recalled the line of houses
on Murphy’s lane was in the following order: Joseph
Johns (later John Tyner), William T. Wauters (later
John Beardsley), John Murphy, Thomas Murphy,
James Murphy, Pat Murphy (the chief ingredients of
“Murphytown”), Bill “Whitehead” Bennett, N. J.
Crane and Alfred Keen (on the corner of the old
Bloomfield road).</p>

<p class='c004'>The Shields Guards was, before the Civil War, one
of the institutions of Murphy’s lane. The armory in
which the guns and accoutrements, loaned by the state,
were stored, was situated some distance back from
Charlie Van Riper’s house, near the present Mt. Prospect
avenue. There were many Irishmen in the
neighborhood and they formed this company as a rival
to the Continental Blues, which numbered Belleville’s
best among its members.</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_110'></a>
  <h4 class='c008'>THE FIRST SUNDAY SCHOOL IN WOODSIDE.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Among Mr. Hine’s papers is a note to the effect
that about 1822 a Sunday school was carried on in
Woodside (for how long he could not ascertain) in
the house of Mr. Joseph Johns, on Murphy’s lane.
This was an old stone house containing two rooms
on the ground floor, in one of which, about fifteen feet
square, the Sunday school was held. The house stood
at the lower end of Murphy’s lane, very near Second
river. It was torn down during the winter of 1886.
Mr. Hine says:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Johns himself does not appear to have been
exactly a saint, but his wife, Peggy, was a woman of
exceptionally fine character and a devoted Christian.
She died thirty-three years ago (this was written by
Mr. Hine in 1887), and those who were children during
her later years speak of their visits to her house
as among the bright spots in their child life. From
the best information I can obtain, it was she who
gathered the children of the neighborhood together
for Sunday instruction, but I learn also of students
from a seminary in Bloomfield who came down there
to teach, and who also established a school in Franklin;
they called it Pobishon. Whether that was an
Indian name of the region or merely a local title, I
do not know, but children from Belleville used to go
to both schools.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have not been able to find out whether this ancient
Woodside school was divided in classes or
taught in a body by the person conducting it; but
<a id='Page_111'></a>the exercises were simple and now and then a tract
would be given to a child, who in those early days, set
great store by the simple gift. I only know of two
persons now living who attended this school of sixty-five
or more years ago: they are Mr. Henry Stimis,
who lives on the River road in Woodside and his sister
Eliza, who are well known to many of us. Mr.
William Wauters, who was a cousin of Mrs. Peggy
Johns, has for many years, and until recently, been
a resident of Woodside, and is the father of two
former faithful workers in this school, the Misses
Lizzie and Lucy Wauters.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In view of the fact that the first Sunday school in
Newark was held in 1814 (Daily Advertiser, Oct. 27,
’83.) it speaks well for this country region that one
was held here only eight years later.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>AN EASY WAY TO DIVIDE EVEN.</h4>
<p class='c006'>As nearly as I can gather from current remark,
Mr. Joseph Johns was a remarkably fine specimen of
an awful example for a temperance lecture—certainly
that appears to be the impression he left behind
among the neighbors. A story still survives which
indicates that Mr. Johns was also somewhat original
in his method of doing things.</p>

<p class='c004'>It seems that he once had a sum of money in
shape like a parcel of bills of tempting thickness, and
Mrs. Johns, believing that it would be rather more
safe in her possession than in his, tried to persuade
him to give it up, but, failing in this, she firmly insisted
<a id='Page_112'></a>that half of the amount belonged to her, and
that he should at least divide. To this proposition he
agreed and, taking the package to the chopping block,
with one whack of an axe he cut it in two and handed
one bundle to his wife, saying “there’s your half”.</p>

<p class='c004'>When he came to and realized the destruction he
had wrought, he was at great pains to paste the bills
together again, and in this condition they were put
into circulation. For some years it was a common
thing to find some of “old Johns’s money” among
change received at the Belleville stores.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>WAUTERS—WAUTERSE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Beyond the Johns house stood the dwelling of
William T. Wauters—Wauterse, as his Dutch forefathers
spelled it. The house is shown on the map of
1849, but could not have been erected a great while
before that date.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>POLLY VAN WINKLE AGAIN.</h4>
<p class='c006'>It seems that Polly Van Winkle, mentioned in
connection with the River road, was an inhabitant of
Bloomfield and used Murphy’s lane as one of her
routes to and from the water side. She left the same
general memory here that she did elsewhere—a little,
old woman, bent nearly double with years and the
weight of an enormous pack, which was her constant
companion.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>MURPHYTOWN.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Not much has been learned of the Murphys, who
appear to have been brought over to work in the
<a id='Page_113'></a>calico mills, and who settled so thickly about midway
of the lane that the spot became known as “Murphytown”.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>A Bit Of Murphy’s Lane. As it was twenty years ago.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h4 class='c008'>THE GYPSIES DO BUSINESS.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Some time before the Civil War a small band of
gypsies, headed by one James Trail, who had been in
the habit of camping in the woods on the south side
of the lane, purchased some of the Murphy property
for the purpose of establishing a winter home. In
those days this was an out of the way spot and quite
suitable for the nomads.</p>

<p class='c004'>During the warm months these gypsies wandered
over the country and at one time, while in Tennesee,
they came upon a gullible person named Ferris. Him
they induced to bury a pot of gold, or at least to allow
them to bury it, at an auspicious moment when the
moon and stars favored increase, on the theory that if
left a certain length of time, long enough to allow
them to get well out of the country, it would multiply
the dollars to a marvellous extent.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the proper time Mr. Ferris dug up the pot and
found it heavily laden with—lead, and was sorely
vexed. So far the plans of the gypsies had worked
as they wished, but what they had not counted on was
the persistence of their victim, who managed to trail
them to their winter lair. He then sought out ’Squire
Sandford of Belleville, and offered him a reward if he
would capture the thieves and get the money back,
which the ’Squire did in short order.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_114'></a>All who knew ’Squire Sandford in his active days
know how useless it was to attempt to bluff him, and
it is hardly necessary to state that the gypsies
promptly came to terms. This resulted in their giving
up the property on Murphy’s lane in order to
avoid further trouble, and the ’Squire received half of
the land in lieu of a money reward.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE BENNETT PROPERTY.</h4>
<p class='c006'>On the far edge of Murphytown stood the home of
Bill “Whitehead” Bennett. There were many Bennetts
in the neighborhood, and it was necessary to
distinguish one “Bill” from another—this one appears
to have been a blond. The records show that the
heirs of Joseph Crane sold this property to John P.
Durand, and he to Simon Sainsimon, he to Daniel
Crane, he to Aaron I. Crane, he to William Bennett,
he to Abram S. Hewitt, and he to Dr. Grenville M.
Weeks. The following items in regard to the ownership
of the property I have from Dr. Weeks.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>PETER COOPER OWNS LAND HERE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Early in the fifties Peter Cooper and Abram S.
Hewitt bought a tract comprising about 38 acres
just beyond “Murphytown”, their intention being to
make a homestead of it, but they did not build. In 1860
Dr. Grenville M. Weeks who was then a young man,
living in Bloomfield, discovered the place and, liking
it both for its beauty and for what he thought would
be its future possibilities as the city grew, saw Mr.
Cooper and asked if he would sell. The latter said
<a id='Page_115'></a>no, as he had purchased intending to make his home
here, but that since then he and his son-in-law had
been looking at a place near Greenwood Lake, and
they might sell a year hence, if they decided on the
latter place, as Hewitt thought the city would crowd
them out of this spot.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>DR. GRENVILLE M. WEEKS COMES ON THE SCENE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>In ’61 the Doctor again called on Mr. Cooper, who
said, “Well, are you as hungry after that place as
ever?” and when the young man said yes, the owner
wanted to know how much he would pay down. The
Doctor who was only twenty-one, had a half interest
in a small drug store in Bloomfield, which had netted
him $500, a very considerable sum to him, and when
he said he had $500, Peter Cooper said, “$500! Young
man, have you any idea what the relation of $500 is
to a $10,000 place?” The Doctor then thought he
could raise another $500, and the owner said, “I will
make a contract and give you a deed when you can
save another $1,000 and give me a mortgage for $8,000.”
The Doctor had by this time entered the Navy,
and was thus enabled to secure the second thousand
and the deal was consummated.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the course of time John I. Briggs bargained for
the property, agreeing to pay $15,000, and paid $100
down to bind the contract, but he never paid interest
on the mortgage, and the Doctor was compelled to
foreclose.</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_116'></a>
  <h4 class='c008'>MR. JAS. YEREANCE A RESIDENT.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Next came Jeremiah Counsellor, a conductor on
the M. &amp; E. R. R., and a well-known character, and
he asked the Doctor for an opportunity to sell the
property, stating that he would sell it inside of a
month, and that he wanted as his commission half of
all he could get over $50,000. This was just before
the panic of ’73, when prices were largely inflated and
the Doctor was naturally pleased, as, having been attached
to the government service most of the time, he
had not appreciated the rise in land values. Shortly
thereafter the sale was made to Mr. James Yereance,
a New York business man, for $57,000, $25,000 being
paid down. The interest was paid for some years,
but Mr. Yereance was finally unable to meet the payments,
and an amicable arrangement was made
whereby part of the property was deeded to the father
of Mr. Yereance and the remainder was bought in by
the Doctor at Sheriff’s sale. The Doctor speaks very
highly of the honest manner in which Mr. Yereance
treated him all through these transactions.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>DR. WEEKS AND THE MONITOR.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Dr. Grenville M. Weeks carries with him a useless
right arm as a memento of the Civil War. He
was surgeon on the Monitor when she sank, and tells
such an interesting story—not only of this event, but
also of the conception and building of the Monitor,
many points of which he says are not commonly
known—that a brief outline of his story is embodied
here:—</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_117'></a>
  <h4 class='c008'>DR. THEODORE RUGGLES TIMBY.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Dr. Theodore Ruggles Timby, who died November
10, 1909, at the age of 91 was, the Doctor believes,
the real inventor of the Monitor. In 1843, Dr. Timby
gave thought to the immense unprotected stretch of
coast which this country presented to an enemy, and
recognized how impossible it would be to construct
forts that would cover its vast extent. It then occurred
to him that if floating forts could be constructed
which could be taken to any point threatened,
the difficulty would be met. It is said that the old circular
fort on Governor’s Island first suggested a revolving
turret to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>By much thinking he gradually evolved the Monitor
type, and fifteen years before the Civil War broke
out had perfected his plans and submitted them to
the various European governments, even sending
them to China, but they all scouted his idea, some one
of them remarking that every inventor had his soft
spot, and evidently that of Dr. Timby was the
thought that he could float an iron ship.</p>

<p class='c004'>Dr. Timby returned home and continued to work
over his plans, placing airtight compartments in bow
and stern, and in such other ways as he could devise
meeting the objections that had been raised.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the Civil War came the inventor managed
to get his plans before Mr. Lincoln, who immediately
became interested, and who used frequently to visit
his workshop in Washington to discuss them. Finally
Mr. Lincoln, who had some knowledge that the Merrimac
<a id='Page_118'></a>was being constructed and knew that something
must be done to meet the emergency, sent Dr.
Timby with his plans to three of the wealthiest and
most prominent men in New York, with a request
that they submit the plans to the best engineer they
could find.</p>

<p class='c004'>These took the model and plans to John Ericsson,
then regarded as the best engineer in the country, and
he, after shutting himself up with them for ten days,
submitted a report in which he stated his belief in the
feasibility of the plan, and that he could construct the
vessel in one hundred days. The order was immediately
given to go ahead, and at the end of the one hundred
days the “Monitor” was floating on the waters
of New York harbor, to all appearances a success.</p>

<p class='c004'>An interesting addition to this story, which belongs
here, comes from Mrs. Lucy Cate Abercrombie
of Forest Hill, and, while it is not part of the Doctor’s
narrative, it helps to complete the history.</p>

<p class='c004'>When Ericsson announced that the Monitor
could be built, he was called to Washington for consultation
and, among other questions, was asked
where the plates necessary to armor the proposed vessel
could be secured. He responded that he did not
know, that such plates were only made in Glasgow,
and that it was impossible to secure them from there,
but that there was a man in Baltimore who had invented
machinery for rolling large plates, and perhaps
he could do the work.</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_119'></a>
  <h4 class='c008'>MR. HORACE ABBOTT MAKES THE MONITOR A POSSIBILITY.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>This was Mr. Horace Abbott, the grandfather of
Mrs. Abercrombie, who had perfected a machine for
rolling heavy plates, by the invention of the third roll,
but he had put his last dollar into the invention and
the stagnation of business due to the war was writing
ruin for him in very large letters. Mr. Abbott was
sent for and a contract was signed, and in forty-eight
hours thereafter the first plate had been rolled, and
this led to other government work. Thus the Monitor
not only saved the fortunes of the Union, but also
those of one of its inventive citizens.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Abbott’s invention revolutionized the methods
employed in rolling heavy plates; it has never been
materially changed and is in use to-day in every rolling
mill in the country.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE MONITOR GOES TO HAMPTON ROADS.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Word was sent to Lincoln that the Monitor was
afloat and he, knowing that the Merrimac was almost
ready, ordered it to proceed immediately to Hampton
Roads. Ericsson, however, responded that this
was impossible, that the vessel was intended only for
harbor defense and would not last in a sea, as she
was merely an iron deck set on a scow with an overhang
at each end of twenty-five feet, and that the
force of the waves under this overhang would lift the
upper works from the hull. He had not followed Dr.
Timby’s plans as to the hull, which would have saved
the vessel in the storm off Hatteras referred to below.
<a id='Page_120'></a>The only excuse for the twenty-five foot overhang
that can be thought of now is that the short hull was
sufficient to float the structure and cost less than a
longer hull. The President, however, sent peremptory
orders that the Monitor should go, and we
all know the result.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>TALE OF THE MERRIMAC’S ENGINEER.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Some years after the close of the war Dr. Weeks
met the engineer of the Merrimac in Dakota, and as
the conversation drifted to the days that had been,
the engineer told how the Southerners were highly
elated at the first success of the Merrimac, and felt
that nothing could stop them, and when they came out
of the James river on the morning that the Monitor
arrived, the captain was annoyed to see what he supposed
was a raft lying between him and his intended
prey, the Minnesota, and not realizing what it was
or that it could offer resistance, ordered full speed
ahead, expecting to ram and destroy the obstruction.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You can imagine our amazement”, said the engineer,
“at the shock of the impact, which threw us to
the deck; it was like running on a ledge of rock.
The iron prow of the Merrimac, which was made
for ramming, was bent and useless, and had we not
struck a slanting blow the result to the Merrimac
would have been serious.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But what finally overwhelmed us were the
enormous balls, eleven inches in diameter, which
came thundering at our railroaded sides until they
began to make breaches. Finally one of these ripped
<a id='Page_121'></a>through us from stem to stern, killing or wounding
seven or more, upsetting gun carriages and causing
terrible devastation. Then it was that we realized
that destruction awaited us unless we could escape.”</p>
<h4 class='c008'>DR. WEEKS TRANSFERRED TO THE MONITOR.</h4>
<p class='c006'>One of the mistakes made by Ericsson was the
placing of the conning tower, from which the vessel
is fought, aft of the turret instead of on its top, as the
plans called for. Because of this the officer in charge
was compelled to swing the bow forty-five degrees
out of her course in order to see ahead. This delayed
the fight greatly and also caused Lieut. John L. Worden,
who fought the Monitor, to be almost blinded
by smoke and burned powder. This fact led to the
transferring of Dr. Grenville M. Weeks to the Monitor,
as it was necessary to relieve Lieutenant Worden
and the Monitor’s surgeon, Dr. Daniel C. Logue,
went with him to the Brandywine, while Doctor
Weeks, who was surgeon on the Brandywine, was ordered
to replace Dr. Logue.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>CAPTAIN BANKHEAD IN COMMAND.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Captain Bankhead succeeded Lieutenant Worden
in command of the Monitor and, as the Doctor says,
there was a certain poetical justice in the succession
of Captain Bankhead to this command. It seems that
a board consisting of General Bankhead, the Captain’s
father, and Colonel Thornton of the army, and Joe
Smith of the navy, had been appointed some years
before to determine whether this was a great piece of
<a id='Page_122'></a>folly, as the Europeans thought, or whether it was of
value, as the inventor believed. Thornton and Smith
reported against the invention, while General Bankhead
made a minority report in its favor. The Bankheads
were Southern men, but loyal when the Civil
War came.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>SINKING OF THE MONITOR.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The Monitor was ordered to Charleston, S. C.,
and on December 29, 1862, was taken in tow by the
Rhode Island, a powerful side-wheel steamer. A West
India hurricane was raging up the Atlantic Coast, and
two days after the start that very thing happened to
the Monitor that was predicted by Ericsson, the tremendous
lift of the seas under the long overhang of
twenty-five feet caused the deck to break away gradually
from the hull, and soon the cabin was awash and
the heavy dining table was crashing into the stateroom
doors and cabin sides as the rolling of the
clumsy little vessel rushed the water from side to side.</p>

<p class='c004'>At this point the Doctor went below for something
and found an engineer so sick in his stateroom
that he did not realize their perilous position, and
when the man refused to move the Doctor attempted
to force him out, but now a wave swept over the deck
and the Doctor, supposing the Monitor was going
down, sprang for the companionway and had to fight
his way up through a solid wall of water.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once outside he sought the top of the turret with
the Captain; in the meantime rockets had been set off
to notify the Rhode Island that her tow was sinking
<a id='Page_123'></a>and the latter had cut her loose. By this time the
fires were nearly out and the Monitor was so waterlogged
that she did not rise to the seas, but dived
into them, while her officers and men could with difficulty
hang on, shutting eyes and mouth until the
flood had swept astern.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Rhode Island immediately proceeded to lower
a boat on its port quarter, but while this was being
done one of the most desperate situations of this desperate
night occurred. In some way an end of the
immense tow rope which had been trailing astern
became entangled in one of the paddle wheels and
stopped the machinery. Thus she lay helpless for the
time being. In the meantime the Monitor, which was
still slowly running under her own power, her fires
as yet not having been drowned out, was bearing
down on the Rhode Island. In the darkness the proximity
of the two boats was not discovered until the
Monitor was on the point of ramming. Just at this
critical moment the paddle wheel was cleared and the
Rhode Island began slowly to forge ahead, and consequently
the blow was not severe enough to cause
serious damage, but it was a heart-rending moment
to those on both of the vessels, who felt that they
were very close to eternity.</p>

<p class='c004'>The collision smashed the boat which was being
lowered but another quickly took its place and, recognizing
how easily it could be stove, this was well
guarded with rope fenders.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_124'></a>It was midnight and very dark, the two vessels
had drifted apart again, but finally the small boat was
discovered close in on their starboard quarter. It did
not dare come alongside, however, for fear of being
smashed, and the men were compelled to jump.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Doctor was one of the last to leave the Monitor,
and by this time the small boat had drifted so far
off that he fell short into the icy water, but those on
board caught him by the hair and collar and he was
dragged to safety. The Doctor will never forget seeing
one of the engineers, who had been the life of the
party and who was loved by all, miss the boat by five
feet as he jumped, and go down in the darkness never
to be seen again.</p>

<p class='c004'>There were sixteen in the small boat, but it was
staunch, and they felt comparatively safe. The waves
were tremendous; at one moment the boat was riding
the crest of a mountain, the next it was engulfed
in the depths. While thus momentarily between two
great seas they dimly saw the bow of a second boat
from the Rhode Island hanging above them, which the
next moment would come down athwartships and
grind them to pulp. A shout of warning enabled each
helmsman to throw his tiller over and sheer off to
some extent, but what saved the situation from becoming
a catastrophe to all was the Doctor’s quick
wit. He tells the story very modestly himself.
Springing up and bracing his feet he grasped the bow
of the oncoming boat as firmly as possible and pushed
<a id='Page_125'></a>it to one side and this, with the prompt action of the
helmsman, just prevented the impending collision,
but, as the one boat came down on the other, the Doctor’s
arm was gripped between them and he was
pulled down to the water, his arm was dragged from
its socket and hung attached to his body by a few
stretched muscles. The intense pain caused him to
faint, and had it not been that the cold water revived
him as his head went under he would have been
pulled overboard.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the boat reached the Rhode Island they
found a spar extended from which depended ropes up
which the sailors scrambled as only a sailor can, and
then the Doctor thought of death, and it was not
pleasant in spite of the intense pain he was enduring.
One sailor lost his grip and fell into the sea, never to
be seen again.</p>

<p class='c004'>What could a man so maimed as the Doctor was
do to save himself under such circumstances? Nothing.
There seemed no hope for him, and he thought
of descending into that watery grave and slowly disintegrating
in the ooze at the bottom of the ocean;
and the horror of it took hold on him, for he was a
young man and wanted to live.</p>

<p class='c004'>Finally all were out of the boat but the men at bow
and stern, the Doctor, and George W. Tichenor, when
the latter shouted that they must do something to
save the man who had saved them all. A rope was
then thrown from the vessel and a bowline passed
<a id='Page_126'></a>over the Doctor’s right shoulder and under his left
arm, and the poor, maimed body was dragged on
board as a bag of potatoes might have been, but he
was saved. It was good to feel the wooden deck under
foot once more.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>NOTES ON THE CRANE FAMILY.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The last property on this old road was the Crane
estate. The first of the name to settle here was Jasper
Crane (born 1680), and he is supposed to have come
here about 1730. The family genealogy goes back to
an earlier Jasper, born 1600, who is said to have been
a son of Gen. Josiah Crane, who was in the service of
King James I. of England. Jasper married in England,
as his son John was born there in 1635. Jasper came
from England about 1639 and was one of the early
settlers of New Haven, Connecticut, where he was a
magistrate for several years. From there he removed
to Branford and from the latter place to Newark in
1665. Here he was a magistrate, was first president
of the Town Council and was first on the list of deputies
to the General Assembly of New Jersey for six
years after the settlement of Newark.</p>

<p class='c004'>John Crane, born 1635, had a son Jasper, born 1680
(the first to settle here). His son Joseph was born
1722; this Joseph had a son Joseph, born 1767, and
his son was Nathaniel Jonas Crane, born 1808.</p>

<p>Crane Homestead. Supposed to have been erected about 1760. Picture taken in 1890. The barn which stood back of this house was the one in which cattle were slaughtered for the troops of General Anthony Wayne.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The old Crane stone house is supposed to have
been erected about 1760 by Joseph Crane; this was
taken down about 1890. The small wing at the right
<a id='Page_127'></a>of the building is believed to have been the older part
of the house. Those now living remember that in the
attic of this part were several swords of various descriptions
which Nathaniel J. Crane has said were
used by members of the family who fought in the
French and Indian War. The barn which stood in
the rear of this house is the one referred to elsewhere
as having been used as a slaughter-house when General
Anthony Wayne was camped under this ridge.</p>

<p class='c004'>Beyond the Crane house is the Keen homestead,
which is mentioned in connection with the old Bloomfield
road.</p>

<p class='c014'>Note for page 126.—Information concerning the Sidman family
which was received after this book was in type and inserted at the

1711. See page <a href='#Page_100'>100</a>.</p>

<p>C. C. Hine In 1895. “There may have been men of greater and more beautiful character than his, but I never knew any and never read of any. I count it one of the most fortunate things of my life to have been for so many years so closely associated with him. While it (the portrait) does not do full Justice to the subject (I do not think any photograph could), it is a face I am glad to look at and it recalls some of the pleasantest memories of my whole life and some of the things which, I am sure, have been of the utmost value to me in many ways. He left nothing but a trail of good wherever he went. My memory is of a <i>life</i> rather than of episodes; I only wish I could describe it as it was lived. The only two absolutely unselfish people I ever knew were Mr. Hine and my own mother.”</p>

  <h3 class='c009'>C. C. HINE AND HIS TIMES.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>This second part is intended to cover as well as
may be the period of time beginning with the opening
of Woodside as a residence section. During these
years Mr. Charles Cole Hine took such an active interest
in the welfare of the neighborhood and was so
wrapped up in and identified with its best interests that
its history is his biography, consequently I feel that
it will be proper to give here a brief outline of his life
previous to the year 1867, when he settled in Woodside.</p>

<p class='c004'>When women could lift their little children up to
“take a last look at the best friend they ever had”, as
was done while the people passed by the coffin of Mr.
Hine as it lay in the church, such as did not come in
direct contact with the man may to some extent understand
what a feeling of love he inspired in those
who knew him.</p>

<p class='c004'>For me he had a living reality that death has never
removed; it was years before I could accept the situation.
Concerning no one else have I ever had the
same feeling. Death has removed others and I have
accepted the condition as final, but for a long period
<a id='Page_132'></a>after the death of my father I had a feeling amounting
to momentary conviction that he had opened the office
door and was coming toward me, and have looked
up from my desk many a time to welcome him. This
could not have been a matter of local association, for
I was occupying an office which he never saw. What
it was I do not know.</p>

<h4 class='c008'>CHARLES COLE HINE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Charles Cole Hine was born in New Haven, Conn.,
December 21, 1825. When six years of age his parents
removed to Hornellsville, N. Y. His father was a carriage
builder, but of nomadic tendencies, and the boy
had small opportunity for schooling, though as a matter
of fact he went to school all his life; he had an instinct
for acquiring knowledge that could not be suppressed,
and as a result those who knew him best in
after life took it for granted that he was a college-bred
man.</p>

<p class='c004'>With the versatility of many another self-made
man he turned his hand to many things in his youth
while finding himself. He once went on a concert
tour with three other young men, driving from town
to town through Ohio and western Pennsylvania.
At one time he turned to art for a living and actually
did support himself, after a fashion, for a brief period,
<a id='Page_133'></a>painting portraits. Mr. Hine’s father moved to Massillon,
Ohio, in 1837, and there the boy grew up and
cast his first vote. Once when clerking in a store in
Massillon, among the commodities of which was a line
of books, the proprietor, who was of a kindly disposition,
allowed the young man to read as he liked, and
as a result he read every book in the place, including
an encyclopædia, some six hundred volumes in all.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the telegraph was young he became interested
in that and established lines through parts of
Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, contracting for poles and
their erection, selecting the local operators and teaching
them the Morse alphabet, and doing any other
missionary work that was needed. That he was something
more in this than ordinary is evidenced by the
fact that in Reid’s “History of the Telegraph in
America” Mr. Hine’s name is frequently mentioned,
and always in complimentary terms. While in
charge of the office in Louisville, he invented a transmitter
to repeat messages in order to save the time of
an operator, for in those days the electric fluid only
carried a message so far, and long distance messages
must needs be repeated by hand. Later some one invented
and patented the same thing and made, I believe,
a fortune by it.</p>

<p class='c004'>An operator in the early days of telegraphy was a
more important personage than at present. Mr. Hine
has told how, when he was stationed in St. Louis,
1848-9, P. T. Barnum was taking Jenny Lind around
<a id='Page_134'></a>the country and, upon reaching St. Louis, he insisted
on getting inside the telegraph office and making the
acquaintance of the operator. As a result he took Mr.
Hine riding with him and gave him two tickets for
each concert, no mean gift when tickets were selling
at $20.00 each.</p>

<p class='c004'>The year 1849 was the year of the cholera and of
the “great fire” in St. Louis. “The city was a charnel
house; funerals were the principal events and the
chief business of the hour; hearses went on a trot
when they could not go faster.” Mr. Hine was convalescing
from the disease and had been carried from
a room at Olive and Main streets to his boarding
house. That same night the “great fire” started on
the levee. Four hundred buildings in the business
heart of the city, which included Olive and Main
streets, were destroyed.</p>

<p class='c004'>While living in St. Louis Mr. Hine met Mary Hazard
Avery, whose parents had also removed from
Connecticut, and was married to Miss Avery in that
city July 4, 1853. Before that time he had established
himself in New Albany, Ind., where in due course he
represented the Adams Express Company, and was
secretary of a plank road, notary for two banks and
agent for several insurance companies, fire and life.</p>

<p class='c004'>While living here the New Albany Theological
Seminary removed to Chicago, leaving a splendid set
of buildings vacant, and Mr. Hine thought he saw the
opportunity of his life in the establishment of a girls’
<a id='Page_135'></a>seminary. The property was easily obtained, and he
spent all the money he had and all he could borrow
fitting up the place but, as he once put it, “the New
Albany Female Seminary opened simultaneously
with the great panic of 1857”. He lost every cent he
had and came out of the crash many thousands of dollars
in debt.</p>

<p class='c004'>When Mr. Hine wished to enter active business
again he bought up the outstanding notes against
him in order to protect himself and, although his
former creditors had no claim on him thereafter, he
gradually paid back every dollar of indebtedness with
interest. In this he followed the somewhat unique
method of ascertaining who among his old creditors
were most in need, and paying these first.</p>

<p class='c004'>As an insurance agent Mr. Hine had represented
the Ætna Insurance Company, whose western general
agent had said to him: “Mr. Hine, if ever you should
want to go into insurance again, please let me know
first”, and after the crash Mr Hine promptly sent
word to the headquarters in Cincinnati that he wanted
a position and as promptly got it. Thereafter he was
connected with the western office of the Ætna until
he removed to New York in 1865. Mr. Hine was
brought east by the offer of the secretaryship of the
International Insurance Company, but the methods
adopted not being to his liking he resigned. He was
then practically offered the position of Superintendent
of the Insurance Department of the State of New
<a id='Page_136'></a>York, but preferring to be his own master and delighting
in editorial work, he purchased the Insurance
Monitor in March, 1868, and that became his life work.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>MR. HINE IN SEARCH OF A HOME.</h4>
<p class='c006'>As soon as his work would permit he began to
look about for a home, and ultimately decided on
Woodside, which was then beginning to be exploited
as a residence section for toilers in the city. In this
connection it can do no harm to tell a little story
which he often told of himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>As a young man he spent many of his leisure hours
painting, and in 1844 painted much with a certain man
in Massillon, Ohio, who was something of an artist,
and during this time painted the man’s portrait, but
he had completely lost sight of his friend for more
than twenty years.</p>

<p class='c004'>In 1866, when looking for a home site, Mr. Hine
answered, among others, an advertisement of a Mr.
M., in Morrisania, and while inspecting the house saw
a portrait which he recognized as that of his artist
friend of 1844, and one which he had seen many times,
but which the lady of the house told him was Mr. M.,
an entirely different name.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the gentleman himself arrived Mr. Hine recognized
him, but neither gave any indication of the
recognition and an appointment was made for Mr. M.
to call at the New York office of his prospective customer
the next day.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<a href='images/winser-home-large.jpg'><img src='images/winser-home.jpg' alt='Home Of Mr. Henry J. Winser.' class='ig001' /></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Home Of Mr. Henry J. Winser. House erected in 1866. Situated at 201 Washington Avenue. In the foreground stands the old apple tree that was used as a talking point by Mr. Ananias.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>In the meantime Mr. Hine got out his old portrait
<a id='Page_137'></a>of the man and placed it in his office where the caller
would see it, expecting a good time in resuming the
old acquaintance, but Mr. M. never came, and inquiry
showed that he had disappeared suddenly, leaving no
address, and that his house was vacant and in the
hands of an agent.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Hine’s portrait of the man hung for many
years over a door in the dining room at No. 209 Washington
avenue, and he was fond of relating an entirely
new supposition accounting for the mysterious disappearance
of the gentleman, which was advanced by
his pastor who, on a certain occasion, was dining at
the house when the story was told, and who “looked
up from his plate, gazed at the picture a moment,
and then looking me square in the eye said, in a calm,
deliberate voice: ‘Maybe he was afraid you would
paint him again.’”</p>
<h4 class='c008'>MR. HINE FIRST VISITS WOODSIDE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Mr. Hine first visited Woodside in August, 1866;
the house at 201 Washington avenue was for sale,
having been erected by a Mr. Babbitt, who was unable
to occupy it. Mr. Hine concluded it could be made
to meet his requirements, and immediately closed the
bargain; but it seems that Mr. Henry J. Winser had
before this discovered the house and, being attracted
by the great trees growing on the place, secured the
refusal of the property for a few days, and it was before
this time had expired that Mr. Hine made the
purchase.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_138'></a>Here was a state of things which was unpleasant
for all except Mr. Babbitt, who had his money, and
he referred Mr. Winser to Mr. Hine, thus dismissing
the matter so far as he was concerned. Mr. Winser as
city editor of the New York Times was then investigating
the Tweed Ring and could not attend to personal
matters, hence it devolved on Mrs. Winser to
open the negotiations which resulted in a sale to Mr.
W. and the purchase of property adjoining on the
north by Mr. Hine.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE FIRST HOUSES ERECTED ON WASHINGTON AVENUE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The Winser family moved in on September 1, 1866.
At this time there were five detached houses on this
(east) side of what was then Belleville avenue; these
were occupied by Messrs. Winser, Best, Baldwin,
Neumann and Daniel F. Tompkins. On the west side
were six houses, occupied (from south to north) by
Messrs. Sommer, an artist; Shannan, Mrs. Van
Wyck, James Gamble, George B. Callen and John
P. Contrell. Between Elwood avenue and Carteret
street the foundations for four houses were laid, and
on the hill above Carteret street Mr. Charles D. Morrison
who, with Mr. John I. Briggs, composed the firm
of Morrison &amp; Briggs, builders, was erecting his own
dwelling. Below these groups on the south there was
no building until we came to the spacious house, embowered
in trees, of Mr. Horace H. Nichols, and
across Washington avenue from Mr. Nichols, at the
<a id='Page_139'></a>point, the house built by Mr. A. P. Scharff, later occupied
by Dr. MacKie, Mr. James A. C. Van Rossam
and one Flavel.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE FIRST HOUSES ERECTED ON LINCOLN AVENUE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>On what was then known as the Back road were
the houses of Colonel Buck, Messrs. Samuel Royce,
Miles I’Anson, E. A. Boyden, John Scharff, John C.
Bennett; the first house of C. D. Morrison, present
corner of May street and Summer place; the old Phillips
farm house and the house of James Swinnerton,
Jr., on the northeast corner of Elwood avenue, which
was then Berkley street.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>HOUSES ERECTED IN 1866-7.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Within the year there were built the houses of Mr.
Hine, Mr. Harlan, C. D. Morrison, Miss Teel, Mr.
Pratt, Mr. Palmer, Mr. Faitoute, Mrs. Jackson, Mr. F.
F. Mercer, Mr. Blackwood, Mr. McDonald and Wm.
Chippendale, the latter a son of Richard Chippendale,
who came to this country on account of the Chartist
troubles in England, and about this time the house of
Mr. Horace Carter on the Gully road was built.</p>

<p class='c004'>Several new houses were built on the River road
near Grafton avenue, and were occupied by Mr. Webster,
Mr. Oliver Gordon, formerly of Brooklyn, who
had a large business with China and was a colleague
of the Lows; and Benjamin Brigg, son-in-law of Mr.
Gordon and the representative of the Brigg woolen
mills in Huddersfield, England.</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_140'></a>
  <h4 class='c008'>HOMES OF AN EARLIER PERIOD.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Of the old settlers there were the houses of Sandford,
Munn, Melius, Colonel Cumming, Stimis, John
McDonald, Coeyman and Weiler, on the River road;
Mr. Alfred Hardwick Gibbs on the high ground north
of the Gully road, known as “Thornhill”; the
“Cedars”, built by Frank Forester (H. W. Herbert),
which had been bought by Mr. Sanchez y Dolce, and
was then occupied by him, and also a group of houses
about the junction of Washington and Grafton avenues
and Halleck Street, which is treated of elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the west side of Belleville avenue near Second
river was the interesting old house occupied by Mr.
and Mrs. Jonathan Bird and Mrs. Bird’s two sons by
a former marriage, Lewis and George Ashmun.
This was a most delightful house, and the hospitality
of the Birds was renowned. Mrs. Bird was a daughter
of the Rev. Dr. Strong, of Massachusetts, and inherited
her gracious manner and charm of conversation
from a long line of ancestors who were among
the best people of New England.</p>

<p class='c004'>They entertained with the grace of the early part
of the nineteenth century, before the advent of that
class of plutocrats that brought ostentatious pomp and
more or less bad manners into society. Mr. Bird was
a gentleman of the old school, and Mrs. Bird one of
the most gracious and beautiful of women. It was
always a delight to attend their evenings at home.
One was sure of meeting all the charming people of
<a id='Page_141'></a>the surrounding country and Newark, and there was
no lack of brilliant conversation. When the gatherings
were not too large and the company could assemble
around the hospitable board the table-talk was
sparkling with wit, while matters of graver import
were freely discussed.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is impossible to say when this old house was
erected; it bears every evidence of having been a very
fine place in its day. One informant recalls having
heard Mrs. Bird state that the house was built before
the Revolution by an Englishman who sympathized
with his king and was consequently compelled to
leave the country when war was declared. This information
Mrs. Bird secured from a daughter of
Harry Coeyman, who had received it from her father.
Presumably this is Henry M. Coeyman, a son of
Minard, who is said to have served in the Revolution,
and the son would thus have come on the scene early
enough to know the facts.</p>

<p class='c004'>The records do not go beyond 1790. On July 5,
1790, James H. Maxwell conveyed the property to
Alexander McComb who, on May 21, 1792, conveyed it
to Daniel McCormick who, on July 18, 1792, conveyed
to Thomas Bennett. The next transfer is a sheriff’s
deed dated June 24, 1812, to Jacob Stout, and on
April 9, 1825, his widow, Frances, conveyed to the
President and Directors of the New Jersey Bleaching,
Printing &amp; Dyeing Company. On September 10,
1829, a sheriff’s deed conveyed to Samuel Wright et
<a id='Page_142'></a>als. Then follow the names of owners as follows:
Andrew Gray, Bolton et als., Edward Dwight et als.,
American Print Works, 1835; James K. Mills, 1853;
George Bird, 1853, and Jonathan Bird, 1859.</p>

<p class='c004'>During the time that the house was occupied by
Mr. Bird the place was approached from Mill street
by a bridge across Second river just above the present
Washington avenue bridge.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>INTRODUCING MR. ANANIAS.</h4>
<p class='c006'>After the many years of unclouded friendship that
have existed between the families of Hine and Winser
it is difficult to realize that there could ever have been
any other state of feeling, but at the outset conditions
were just the reverse and the cause of it is rather an
interesting little story.</p>

<p class='c004'>Both homesteads were situated within what was
once a Stimis apple orchard and each contained several
magnificent apple trees that were probably over
one-hundred years old, and it was one of these trees
and an unruly tongue that caused the trouble. The
tree in question was a picturesque old giant that stood
on the Winser premises near the street and near Mr.
Hine’s line.</p>

<p class='c004'>A neighbor of both families, whom we will call
Mr. Ananias, took a dislike to Mr. Hine, even before
his house was finished, and undertook to make trouble
for him. Knowing that both families admired and
valued the trees which adorned their places he pitched
on this particular apple tree, and first called on Mr.
<a id='Page_143'></a>Winser and during a conversation managed to introduce
the subject of the new neighbor, incidentally remarking
that Mr. Hine, who was a new-rich upstart
from the west, had taken a dislike to the Winser
family and, having learned of its love of trees, had
announced that he was going to have that apple tree
down, Winser or no Winser, under the pretense that
it interfered with his view.</p>

<p class='c004'>Having planted and properly watered the seed of
discord he proceeded to sow tares in the next field by
informing Mr. Hine that the Winsers had expressed
themselves in a very disparaging way concerning him
and his, proposing to annoy him in any way they
could and, having heard of his admiration for this
great apple tree, intended to cut it down to spite him.</p>

<p class='c004'>After this it was quite natural that the families
should pass by on the other side—in fact the one
turned its back on the other in so pronounced a
fashion that there was no overlooking it.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Winsers saw the family move in and noted
that it consisted of one gentleman, two ladies and
three children, and concluded that the slender lady,
who was in black, was a widow, and that the slender
boy was her son. And thus matters stood until one
morning there was a bad accident in the Hine kitchen
and Miss Avery, the supposed widow, came over for
help. The cook had been burned and Mr. Hine, in
beating out the flames, had had his hands burned until
the skin hung from them in shreds.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_144'></a>Carron oil was wanted and a doctor was wanted,
and Mrs. Winser, who was home alone at the time,
did all in her power to assist the distressed by sending
her horse for the doctor and coming to offer personal
help. When she first saw Mr. Hine he was sitting
with hands extended to avoid contact with anything,
and when she expressed a wish to help he gladly accepted,
but voiced his surprise that, feeling as she did,
the offer should be made. This led to a prompt retort,
and almost before they knew it the situation was
explained and the eyes of both opened, and thereafter
there was a well-worn path between the two houses.
During the ten days or more that Mr. Hine was confined
to the house Mrs. Winser took down any matters
he wished to dictate and made frequent journeys
to his New York office in his behalf.</p>

<p class='c004'>Much might be told in regard to the sayings of
Mr. Ananias, but possibly one or two more of his
pleasantries will suffice:—</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Winser recalls her first visit to Woodside
and the swarms of mosquitoes in the horse cars that
were on hand to greet her: they were the real Jersey
mosquitoes of well-defined propensity. It was August,
and as she and Mr. Winser alighted in front of
the house, which was then building, and which later
became theirs, they were met by Mr. A., and to him
voiced their opinions of the pests, but he waived it off
with the casual remark that Woodside only had mosquitoes
for a week or ten days during the middle or
<a id='Page_145'></a>latter part of August, and while they were bad then,
it was only for a brief period.</p>

<p class='c004'>In July, 1867, Mr. Winser sailed for Europe on the
destroyer “Dunderburg”, built by Mr. Webb, but
finished too late for use in the Civil War, and which
had been purchased by the French government. The
trip was considered dangerous, as the vessel had been
intended merely for coast defense, and the traveler
not only made his will, having been warned that he
was going to a watery grave, but left the most minute
written instructions to help Mrs. Winser over the
rough places.</p>

<p class='c004'>What was Mrs. Winser’s astonishment when, as
soon as her husband was out of reach, “the Woe of
Woodside” (our friend Ananias) came to her with a
memorandum saying that Mr. Winser had pledged
himself to pay $300 toward the erection of an Episcopal
church in Woodside. This was news to her, and
she searched the book of written instructions in which
all claims and all money matters had been entered by
Mr. Winser without being able to find that he had
made such a pledge as was claimed.</p>

<p class='c004'>When she made this announcement to Mr. A. he
promptly answered: “Well, if this amount is not paid
by you, your husband’s honor will be at stake and
you will be the cause”. Imagine the feelings of this
wife of fifteen months when told that she must pay
this moral (!) obligation or cover her husband’s name
with dishonor. Finally, without consulting any one
<a id='Page_146'></a>versed in the ways of the world, Mrs. Winser paid
over the money and, according to Mr. A., the name of
H. J. Winser was put down on the subscription list
with others, but some weeks later she learned that the
name was not down among subscribers, but headed
the list, and was used as a means of extracting money
from other Episcopalians in the neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Winsers had brought their letters to Christ
Church in Belleville, and had had no thought of making
any change; hence, on the return of Mr. Winser,
and the facts being known, he was filled with wrath.
It was too late, however, to do anything. The reason
for this conduct on the part of Mr. A. is supposed to
have been purely monetary, as he expected to profit
by the work involved in the erection of the proposed
church building.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus when one acquainted with all the circumstances
once remarked that “the church was conceived
in sin and born in iniquity” the statement is
thought to meet the situation with a fair degree of accuracy.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Winser was later appointed treasurer of the
church guild, and had great satisfaction in making
Mr. A. toe the mark when his part of the work was
not properly done.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>ST. JOHN’S EPISCOPAL CHURCH.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Until the building was under cover services were
held in Morrison’s Hall, Washington avenue, opposite
Elliott street, and the Lenten services, morning and
<a id='Page_147'></a>evening, in the Winser house; but, as I understand
it, when the church was organized some of the first
services were held in Mr. Hine’s house, as witness the
following:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“At the first regular meeting of the Vestry of St.
John’s church of Woodside, N. J., the following
resolution was offered by Mr. E. A. Condit and
unanimously adopted:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“Resolved, that the Vestry of St. John’s Church,
Woodside, hereby tender their acknowledgments to
C. C. Hine, Esquire, for his numerous acts of kindness
and courtesy in their behalf, and especially for
the free use of his house as a place of public worship
during the past summer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Resolved, that the Secretary communicate this
resolution to Mr. Hine and record the same in the
minutes of the Vestry.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“E. A. CONDIT,</div>
      <div class='line'>”Secy. of the Vsty.“</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>On September 15, 1868, St. John’s Church was
dedicated, the church building having been in use for
some time previous to this. The annals of the parish
pass this service over. Bishop Odenheimer and some
twenty odd clergymen were present.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rev. Mr. Lounsbury was the first rector; he remained
only a short time and Rev. Samuel Hall succeeded
him in February, 1868.</p>

<p class='c004'>The following notes are from the parish register:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“First meeting to organize, September 2, 1867.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was followed by Rev. George W. Lincoln, who
was succeeded by Rev. Rowland S. Nichols, the present

<h4 class='c008'>A WOODSIDE MOLASSES JAR.</h4>
<p class='c006'>That the women of Woodside were unusually attractive
there is no denying. Of one of them it is told
that she found herself in Newark rather late one
evening after the cars had ceased to run and, being
<a id='Page_149'></a>alone and unable to secure a livery team (for Newark
was as primitive in its way forty years ago as was
Woodside) she applied at the police station for help
and an officer was sent with her on the walk home.
They evidently had a very pleasant trip, for it was not
more than three days later that the officer appeared at
the lady’s home, dressed in his best, only to find that
she was married. An introduction to the husband
somewhat cooled his ardor.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>CAPT. KIDD IN THE WINSER BACK YARD.</h4>
<p class='c006'>There is a tradition that Captain Kidd buried
treasure at a point in the Winser back yard where
an ancient apple tree flourished when we were young,
and the following facts seem to show good foundation
for the belief:—</p>

<p class='c004'>We are told that oft during the quiet of the night
(this was before the day of the trolley and its outrageous
roar) the sound of a pick being driven vigorously
into the earth could be heard from the direction
of the old tree, but when the hearers gazed out
into the dark no one could be seen. Those watching
with the sick frequently noted such sounds, and as
there were no visible diggers and the following morning
no indications that the earth had been disturbed,
it seems impossible that the work could have been
done by other than the shades of the departed pirates.
What, indeed, is to prevent our supposing that the
ghost of the pirate captain himself was on hand, superintending
the work in his old burying ground?</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_150'></a>Then there were the snakes that guarded this old
apple tree—great black snakes of a peculiarly ferocious
and menacing aspect—which, as is well attested
by the most reliable witnesses, were known to
deliberately simulate crooked sticks which, when
about to be picked up by some unsuspecting human,
would dart out a fiery tongue and with a terrible
hissing sound drive the too venturesome explorer to
the uttermost parts of the Winser lot.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>MORRISON &amp; BRIGGS.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Morrison &amp; Briggs were the chief builders of the
first Woodside houses. As nearly as can now be
learned it seems probable that it was they who induced
Messrs. Parker &amp; Keasbey to purchase land
here about 1865, open streets and lay out sites for
residences. The builders at first had a very small
shop on Berkley street (now Elwood avenue) immediately
adjoining the house of Mr. Swinnerton, but it
was not long before they erected a two-story woodworking
establishment on Washington avenue, just
north of Elliott street.</p>

<p class='c004'>Charlie Morrison, of the firm, was a curious specimen,
good natured to a degree it would appear, for he
was seemingly so unwilling to disappoint any one
that he would promise the impossible without a blink.
His fondness for moving was epitomized by his better
half (very much better) once when she remarked
that if he died first she should have his coffin put on
wheels, as he would never be content to rest in one
place long.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_151'></a>Morrison &amp; Briggs had not been exactly trained
in the art of building but they managed to bungle it
through in one way and another. The house at 209
Washington avenue is an example: this was built in
1866-7, and my recollection is of hearing that the cellar
wall must needs be torn down twice before it
would pass inspection. When the last payment on the
house was due it was necessary to furnish the builders
with a list (quite a long one) of those things left
undone with a gentle intimation that the final check
would be forthcoming when the deficiencies were supplied.
There was then a very good feint at something
doing, when another list, somewhat shorter than the
first, was handed to the builders, and so by a gradual
process of elimination, as it were, the house was pronounced
complete.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE SAD FATE OF THE WINSER HORSE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>During the winter of 1868 the Winser horse came
to a bad end. It seems that a brother of a certain
General S. had rented a house on Halleck street, and
as the General was an old friend of Mr. Winser it was
taken for granted that the Major, his brother, was
of the same standing, and he was immediately taken
into the Winser bosom.</p>

<p class='c004'>About this time the Winsers, having small use for
their horse, had arranged to board it for a period in
Westchester County, but when the Major heard of
this he suggested that he take the animal, and that
then if they wanted it at any time it would be near by.
<a id='Page_152'></a>This was more than agreeable to the owners, and
“Nelly” was soon installed in the Major’s stable.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the course of ten days Mr. Winser dropped in
to see how his favorite was coming on, and was told
by a stableman that his master had driven her to
Pamrapo where he was superintending some road
building. This seemed reasonable, but when a second
visit some two weeks later elicited the statement that
the Major had shipped “Nelly” from Pamrapo to
Maryland, and it was found that the Major’s house
was closed and that he would not return until January,
it seemed about time to move in the matter.</p>

<p class='c004'>The case was laid before a well-known lawyer in
Newark, who would not touch it because the Major
and he were on the same Republican Committee. It
was then given to Mr. Runyon, later Chancellor and
Ambassador to Berlin, and he, not being of the same
political faith as the Major, took the case with great
gusto.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Major turned up in Newark in the course of
time and the case was heard before Judge Depue.
The Major said that “Nelly’s” bones were bleaching
on the Eastern Shore of Maryland; that she was absolutely
valueless, and that he had taken her out of
pure pity to save her from ill-treatment. He had but
one witness, who declared that he had driven with
the Major, and had no hesitation in saying the horse
was lame, half starved and not fit to be put in harness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Runyon demolished this testimony by proving
<a id='Page_153'></a>that this witness had no knowledge of the points
of a horse, by showing that he was indebted to the
Major for his position at that time and that he had not
seen the horse until she had been in the Major’s possession
for some time. The Major was inclined to be
flippant with the Court and, finally, when asked how
he stood in regard to certain transactions, he answered
that he “stood in his shirt and trousers”. The
judge warned him that he would have to answer for
contempt of court.</p>

<p class='c004'>After ten minutes’ deliberation the jury returned a
verdict against the defendant for $400 for the value
of the horse and also assessed the costs on him, but
it is needless to say that he never paid either amount,
being a politician of note. The Republican party in
Newark has certainly been loaded with a hard lot of
citizens, first and last.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE OPENING OF WASHINGTON AVENUE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>It will now be necessary to go back a bit in our
chronology in order to get at the beginnings of the
Woodside we know.</p>

<p class='c004'>The opening of Washington avenue, about 1865,
was the beginning of a new era for the neighborhood,
for then Parker and Keasbey purchased a considerable
tract in the vicinity of Washington and Elwood
avenues and cut it up for suburban dwelling purposes
and Morrison &amp; Briggs, contractors, appeared on the
scene.</p>

<p class='c004'>To be sure “the opening of the new highway consisted
<a id='Page_154'></a>merely in setting the fences back and making
a narrow cut through the hill just north of Carteret
street, the earth from which was used to fill the ravine
further north”. A single car track was then laid
from the cemetery to Second river, and Woodside was
open for business.</p>

<p class='c004'>But it was not Woodside in those days. The first
name attached to the locality, and which appears to
have come into use about 1863, was Ridgewood.
There was, however, a post office of this name already
established in the state, and when the town was set
off from Belleville the name was changed to the present
form.</p>

<p class='c004'>In 1865 this was a part of Belleville, but it was
not long before efforts were made for a separation, as
the following documents indicate:—</p>

<p class='c004'>If there were more names than these they were on
another sheet which has been lost.</p>

<p class='c004'>The separation was effected apparently without
much difficulty, and thereafter for a brief period
Woodside was independent. For the gobbling of it
by Newark see the early pages of this book.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>REMINISCENCES BY MR. SWINNERTON.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The following items are taken from the “Reminiscences”
by Mr. James Swinnerton, which were
<a id='Page_158'></a>read before the Woodside Sunday School on the occasion
of its twentieth anniversary, 1887.</p>

<p class='c004'>“At first a single stage which ran every hour was
the only public conveyance between Newark and
Belleville. This region was then a very primitive
neighborhood. Early comers recall the fact that
Washington Irving and his friends roamed over
these beautiful hills and wooded vales with gun and
dog. It was a veritable Sleepy Hollow, and Irving,
had he been a resident, instead of an occasional
visitor, might easily have rendered the Passaic and
its valley as famous as he did Tarrytown and the
Hudson. The hill above Carteret street through
which Washington avenue was cut was then a well
known spot to sportsmen, quail, ground-doves and
rabbits being the chief game as now recalled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The infusion of new blood in Belleville quickened
the old, a direct avenue to Newark was demanded
and a horse railroad determined upon. Farmers and
others gave their time and the use of their teams to
break through the ridge north of Carteret street, and
a rough pathway was made over the hills to the
bluff on this side of Second river. Those traveling
further north must do so on foot after descending
the bluff by a steep flight of steps and crossing the
river on a rickety foot bridge of logs.”</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE WOODSIDE OF 1867.</h4>
<p class='c006'>“The early settlers found a country beautiful to
behold, but with the usual discomforts of a new
<a id='Page_159'></a>place. There were no stores, when short of provisions
neighbor must forage on neighbor; there were
no schools, Sunday or secular; there were no
churches, there were no Sunday horse cars—ride to
church we could not. There were no sidewalks, but
there was a superabundance of mud—walk, therefore,
we dared not. Those who were bold enough to
do so found mud over shoe and usually arrived at
the church door in a state of mind. Mud in Woodside
at this time came early in the fall, stayed the
winter out and lingered through the spring. Goloshes
were at a premium and blacking brushes at a
discount.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A Woodsider of the period has been compared to
a duck standing on one foot, with the difference
that the duck stands thus from instinct, the Woodsider
for the reason that he had no spot on which to
place his other foot.</p>

<p class='c004'>“During the day the horse-cars ran on twenty and
forty-five minutes’ headway and seldom ventured
out after dark, owing largely to the peculiar facility
with which they ran off the track and the difficulty
of setting them in the straight and narrow way
again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your present get off, cross over and wait for the
bob-car arrangement is an improvement on the past,
decidedly; as such it may afford you some consolation
and hope for the future”. (Mr. Swinnerton thus
wrote in 1887 when there was loud and prolonged indignation
<a id='Page_160'></a>over the “bobtail” car service furnished
Woodside).</p>

<p class='c004'>These with other discomforts made life in Woodside
interesting and will serve to show the situation
during the first year. We were without the bread of
life—often short of the bread that perisheth.</p>

<p class='c004'>As there were no sidewalks the middle of the road
was used as a foot path by those too early for the
next car. “One day”, writes Mr. Swinnerton, “in the
middle of the road, and in the spring of 1867, I met
and was introduced to Mr. Hine. After the usual
civilities Mr. Hine declared his purpose to start a
Sunday school just as soon as he had moved into
the settlement. This was good news, but I wondered
how the ways and means were to be provided.
Many of us had spent our last dollar when moving
in, and there was not a spare room in the hamlet large
enough to accommodate a Sunday school.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Several months before this the residents met under
an old apple tree before the door of a small carpenter
shop (Morrison &amp; Briggs’s) to consider church
and other interests, but the carpenter shop had disappeared
and the apple tree promised little comfort
beyond shade.</p>

<p>Home Of Mr. C. C. Hine, 209 Washington Avenue. In this house three churches have been organized, Presbyterian, Episcopalian and Dutch Reformed.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“When I ventured to ask ‘where?’ Mr. Hine’s reply
‘In my own house’ afforded me a new experience.
The notion of any one inviting the children of a
neighborhood to his home for religious instruction
was novel.”</p>

  <h4 class='c008'>THE SUNDAY SCHOOL OF JUNE 16, 1867.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>“Business engagements prevented my attendance
at the first session of the school, but its praises were
sung by the bairns at home and on the second Sabbath
I went over, expecting to find a few scholars
and a teacher or two arranged around an out-of-the-way
room. To my surprise teachers and scholars in
crowds were pouring into the house by the front
door. On entering I saw chairs and benches in the
parlor and the room occupied by the larger children;
the library held the infant department, and there
was provision for a Bible class in the hall.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The school was in full swing—children singing—Mr.
Hine leading and thumping a melodeon vigorously
with one finger and a thumb—his practice
when no five-fingered player was at hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This show of life and activity was contagious. I
fell into line at once by offering to fill the position
of librarian. Mr. Hine’s reply to my offer, ‘we will
look no further, but you must find your own library’,
was characteristic of the man and the school.
Money and books were in hand by the following
Sunday.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Church services were also held in the parlor of
Mr. Hine’s house. The Rev. Mr. Scofield, pastor of
<a id='Page_162'></a>the Central Presbyterian Church, Newark, preached
the first sermon from the text, “What think ye of
Christ?” Several city pastors filled the pulpit—or,
rather, stood at the table, propping up the Bible with
a pile of books.</p>

<p class='c004'>Invitations to preach were frequently extended in
this form: “We shall be very happy to have you
come, but there will be no fee and you must bring
yourself as there are no cars, and not a horse in the
whole congregation.” Ministers from a distance
came Saturday nights and “boarded round”. Theological
students accepted invitations, bringing their
first sermon, and glad enough of an opportunity to
try it on a real congregation.</p>

<p class='c004'>The following letter from Mr. Swinnerton, found
among some of Mr. Hine’s old papers, is inserted here
as it is interesting in this connection:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“Newark, N. J., July 16, 1867.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Hine:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dear Sir—Send this just to let you know how we
got along with the meetings on Wednesday and the
Sabbath and, I am happy to say, first-rate. At the
prayer meeting there was a fair attendance. Mr. and
Mrs. Boyden led the singing. Messrs. Teal, Bennett,
<a id='Page_163'></a>Pettit, Teal Junior and myself took part in the
exercise.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>The Front Door At 209 Washington Avenue. Through which the Sunday School teachers and scholars streamed each Sabbath for eighteen months beginning with June 16, 1867.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“The Sabbath school attendance was 56 against 57
Sabbath previous. Mr. Taylor gave us a new chapter
in Sunday school experience. Singing good.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Dixon preached at night; the service very
interesting; good singing. Mr. S. was not very well
but remarked on Monday morning that it had done
him more good to come up and preach for us and
breathe the country air than if he had stayed at
home. We had a full house. We filled the aisle
with chairs and there were, besides, nearly a dozen
persons in the hall. Mr. Pettit led on Wednesday.
I report progress with books—bookcase painting.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Shall see about preaching for next Sunday to-day.</p>

      <div class='line'>“Yours truly,</div>
      <div class='line'>”J. SWINNERTON.“</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h4 class='c008'>A CHURCH BELL IS PROCURED.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Occasionally an expected supply would fail to
come, and those who gathered for the services were
then disappointed. To meet this Mr. Hine purchased
a bell and hung it in the tower of his house and this,
by clangor or silence, gave notice to all the country
side. There were no street lights, and those attending
<a id='Page_164'></a>evening service on moonless nights have been
likened unto swarms of fireflies as they ranged over
the fields toward the house, every man with a lantern
in hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>Building up a congregation without the help a
pastor can give, and raising money for a church edifice,
are no light tasks. Several of the families held
cherished church connections in Newark which they
were loath to give up; others were indifferent.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>FAIRS, CAKE SALES AND LECTURES.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The few especially interested worked with varying
experiences. Fairs were held, the ladies baked
cakes and gave them to the fair, the cakes were purchased
by their husbands and carried home again.</p>

<p class='c004'>In October Mr. Henry J. Winser gave a lecture
for the benefit of the church in the house of Mr. Hine,
his subject being his recent trip across the Atlantic
in the Dunderberg. As showing the capacity of the
house, a circular issued at the time states that “about
200 persons can be seated”.</p>

<p class='c004'>[Illustration: Third page of poster.]</p>

<p class='c004'>The basement of a Newark church was secured
for a midwinter festival (see copy of poster); we
were snowed under, and with difficulty reached our
firesides.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_165'></a>An auction of choice engravings and Prang’s
chromos was attempted in the third story of a desolate
building in Newark near the Market one Saturday
night. Few people attended the sale and none
purchased the pictures. At a similar attempt in
Belleville chromos to the value of $1.25 were sold and,
on counting the cash, it was found to be thirty-seven
cents short.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE RETREAT FROM BELLEVILLE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>“Moscow to Napoleon was a trifle compared to
our retreat from Belleville that wintry night. Silently
we carried our goods through that long-drawn-out
village. Looked at through the mist of
time this appears like a trifling incident, but then
the giant Despair loomed above us, and it was only
the splendid courage of Mr. Hine and his indomitable
energy and perseverance which kept us going.
Family interests he sacrificed for the common weal.
To every objection there came but one reply: ‘I
have enlisted for the war, and until a permanent
building is erected my doors will stand open.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They did stand open for eighteen months, or until
January 3, 1869, when the second building erected
for church and Sunday school purposes in Woodside
opened its doors—the Woodside Presbyterian
Church—St. John’s Church having been opened
some months previous.” (Here ends Mr. Swinnerton’s
very interesting paper).</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE ERIE RAILROAD.</h4>
<p class='c006'>One of the advertised inducements to settlers in
<a id='Page_166'></a>Woodside was direct railroad connection with New
York. The Erie had leased the Paterson, Newark &amp;
New York Railroad, which was opened in 1868 and
connected with the Newark &amp; Hudson Railroad to
Jersey City, also leased to the Erie. This promised
blessing was slow in coming, for at least three years
elapsed before the New York connection was made,
and in the meantime those whose business called
them to the greater city must take the occasional
horse car or walk to the D., L. &amp; W. (which in those
days stood for “Delay, Linger and Wait”).</p>

<p class='c004'>The Erie has ever been to a Woodsider as a red
rag to a bull. The extremely limited service of the
“Newark Branch” and the absolute indifference of the
management toward the convenience of travelers have
been so pronounced as always to give the impression
that the road regarded passengers as a necessary evil,
to be endured but not encouraged and, as a result,
hundreds in the old days turned from it in disgust
and went elsewhere. It is safe to say that the Erie
was the chief factor in holding the growth of this section
in check, while to-day its foul breath blackens the
heavens and desecrates the landscape as its engines
vomit vast clouds of smudgy soft coal smoke with
a villainous impudence that can nowhere be equaled.
The Erie is the only railroad with more than one
stop in Newark that charges more to one station than
to another, and no other gives so little or so poor
service. Such is its uniqueness.</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_167'></a>
  <h4 class='c008'>THE MAKING OF A SUNDAY SCHOOL.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Mr. Hine took up his abode in Woodside on April
1, 1867. The following circular shows how prompt
he was in starting the Sunday School:—</p>

<p class='c014'>SUNDAY SCHOOL IN WOODSIDE.</p>

<p class='c016'>There will be a Sunday School at the house of
Mr. C. C. Hine, on Belleville Avenue, on Sunday
June 16, 1867, at Half-past Two o’clock, p. m. All
who feel an interest in this work are cordially invited
to be present at that hour. Arrangements have
been made for good singing and plenty of it. This
SUNDAY SCHOOL is intended to be permanent.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the Evening, at Eight o’clock, Rev. Mr.
Scofield, from the Central Presbyterian Church of
Newark, will preach on “THE PRECIOUSNESS
OF CHRIST.”</p>

<p class='c016'>On Wednesday Evenings, at Eight o’clock, until
further notice, there will be Social Prayer Meetings.</p>

<p class='c016'>All these Services are intended to be permanent.</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_168'></a>
  <h4 class='c008'>A “BEFORE-THE-WAR” STORY.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Mr. Hine’s love for the Sunday school is so well
known that no one will be surprised to learn that as
a young man, and while traveling, he once taught a
class in an Atlanta (Ga.) Sunday school.</p>

<p class='c004'>This was before the war, and Mr. Hine used to
tell as a good joke on his self-esteem, how adults
gathered about his class to listen, until they outnumbered
the scholars. This naturally made him feel
somewhat elated until he found later that his auditors,
learning that he was from the North, had gathered
to ascertain whether he would inject any abolition
talk into his teaching. The young man, however,
was too wise to try anything of that sort, and was
more than thankful that he had been when he discovered
the true cause of his popularity.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE MAKING OF A CHURCH.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Even before the Sunday school Mr. Hine had inaugurated
church services in his dwelling, as is evidenced
by this second circular:—</p>

<p class='c014'><a id='Page_169'></a>Presbyterian Church in Woodside.</p>

<p class='c016'>Since the 9th of June public worship has been held
in a private house in Woodside, the Presbyterian ministers
of Newark officiating. A weekly Prayer Meeting
has also been sustained since the same date. A Sunday
School was organized on the 16th of June, and its roll
now includes 84 names.</p>

<p class='c016'>Application was duly made to Presbytery, and a
committee of Ministers and Elders was appointed to visit
Woodside and organize a Church, which duty they performed
on the evening of Monday, Sept. 23d. Seventeen
members united at that time, seven others have signified
their intention of doing so, and it is thought the
number will soon be increased to thirty.</p>

<p class='c016'>An eligible lot of nearly a half acre has been secured,
and subscriptions, sufficient to pay for it, made by the
residents. An appeal is now made to the Newark
Churches for means with which to build a Chapel.
$4,000 or $5,000 will be needed.</p>

<p class='c016'>The rapid growth and flattering prospects of Woodside
are well known in this community, and the importance
of FIRST occupying this promising field can hardly
be over estimated. Generous encouragement promptly
extended will, under God’s blessing, result in the speedy
up-building of a much needed place of worship.</p>

<div>
  <a id='Page_170'></a>
  <h4 class='c008'>THE FIRST CHURCH OF WOODSIDE.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The following “Annals of the First Presbyterian
Church of Woodside” are copied from memoranda in
Mr. Hine’s handwriting:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“Woodside, Essex County, N. J.</p>

<p class='c004'>“June, 1867.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The first Public Worship held in Woodside was
at 8 o’clock on the Evening of Sunday, June 9, 1867,
in the house of Mr. C. C. Hine on Belleville avenue.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rev. Wm. C. Scofield of the Central Presbyterian
Church, Newark, preached a stirring discourse from
the text, ‘What think ye of Christ?’</p>

<p class='c004'>“After the sermon it was announced that a Sunday
school would be organized in the same place at
2-1/2 o’clock p. m. on the following Sabbath; and on
a vote to establish and maintain a Social prayer
meeting twenty hands were raised pledging attendance.</p>

<p class='c004'>“At this date the village of Woodside is a mere
suburban settlement, containing some forty houses
that have all been built within the past sixteen
months (this, of course, refers to the Washington
avenue neighborhood). The want of Church privileges
has been deeply felt, and this movement is designed
to supply that want, draw the people of
Christ together and build up a Church wherein and
whereby He may be honored and souls saved.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Saturday, June 8th, was a rainy day. The storm
continued furious over night and until after midday
Sunday. At sunset it was fair. Notice had been inserted
<a id='Page_171'></a>in the Newark evening paper, and on Sunday
afternoon forty-one houses were visited (by Mr.
Hine himself) and personal invitation extended.
About one hundred people assembled and the accommodations
were crowded to their utmost
capacity.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wednesday Evening, June 12, 1867.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Twenty-five persons attended the first prayer
meeting to-night. Messrs. Hine, Teal, Bennett and
Pettit prayed—in the order written, and with singing
and remarks and reading a part of Luke 12th
the hour was profitably spent.”</p>
<h4 class='c008'>MR. HINE’S HOUSE THE FIRST CHURCH BUILDING.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The parlor of Mr. Hine’s house was left unfurnished;
it was a room 15x25 feet and the arrangement
was such that the hall and the “library” across
the hall could be used as an overflow. He purchased
benches for the main room and placed a speaker’s
table at the front end of the room, so that it commanded
the hall and beyond, as well as the parlor.
A bell so heavy that it shook the entire house, when
in use, was hung in the tower, and his eldest, who,
though young, was a husky lad, recalls with many a
smile how he used to shift those long, heavy benches
to meet the varying requirements of the day, displaying
a species of muscular Christianity at this time
which greatly pleased his sire, and how he would sit
on the tower stairs and study his Sunday school lesson
while he rang the bell for church or school.</p>

<p class='c004'>But not all were of so becoming a disposition, for
<a id='Page_172'></a>I am told that Mr. A. P. Scharff, who taught a class
in Sunday school, called his scholars a “Band of
Hope”, as that was the only thing he could do for them.</p>

<p class='c004'>I very clearly recall being a member of the
infant class—Class No. 9—under Miss Hannah Teel
of blessed memory, and seating myself with other infants
on the ledge of a book case in the library. If
ever there was a good woman and a faithful one, it
was Miss Teel, who watched over that infant class for
many years, and who was wholly unconscious that
she was doing anything more than her plain duty.
That kindly face is indelibly impressed on the
memory of many grown-ups who were once children
of the infant class.</p>

<p class='c004'>Of Miss Teal an old-time neighbor says: “Her
memory is dear to all who were children in the early
seventies. She was a woman of much executive
ability and, in addition to her Infant Class in the
Sunday school, she had a school for young children.
Her sway was mild, but firm, and she delighted in
teaching the little girls not alone the four necessary
branches and sewing, but also many gems of poetry
suitable for their young minds. In her home she was
the mainstay of the household.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Three churches were organized in this house,
which can truly be called the First Church of Woodside:
the Presbyterian, St. John’s Episcopal, and the
Dutch Reformed, the latter being formed after a split
in the Presbyterian congregation.</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_173'></a>
  <h4 class='c008'>A SPLIT IN THE PRESBYTERIAN CONGREGATION.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>In organizing the first church the majority favored
the Presbyterian denomination, and funds were collected
for a church building, which was duly erected
on Carteret street. The first minister was one Clarence
Eddy, and he proved so very unsatisfactory that
he was soon invited to resign. I believe that the governing
body of the Church had had occasion to censure
the reverend gentleman for something, and later
found that the minutes containing the censure had
been tampered with. This was the last straw, and
Mr. Eddy was given an easy opportunity to vacate,
as the following letter indicates:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“Woodside, N. J.</p>

<p class='c004'>”June 15, 1870.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rev. Clarence Eddy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dear Sir—The undersigned, members of your
congregation, beg respectfully to express the belief
that a dissolution of your connection with the church
is, under existing circumstances, desirable.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We, therefore, earnestly request that you will
take early steps to consummate the separation; and
this we do in a spirit of kindness to yourself and of
regard for the church. We entertain no sentiment
of personal hostility towards you and desire the
separation to be made in such a manner as shall least
disturb your own feelings and interests, both professional
and private, and best conserve all the important
relations involved.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This letter was signed by forty-six members of the
<a id='Page_174'></a>church, including the families of Messrs. Hine, Nichols,
Halsey, Swinnerton, Beach, Dovell, Blackwood,
Harlan, Briggs, Smith, Snowdon, McDonald, Whitehead,
Coeyman, Boyden, Slater, Maclure, Carter,
Snyder, Baldwin and Tompkins.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Eddy refused to accept the gentle hint and
it then became necessary to take the matter before
the Newark Presbytery, which held several highly
spiced meetings, and which finally decided that “we
must support the poor minister”, as one of the other
“poor” ministers incautiously stated in public, and
there was nothing left for those who had organized
the church and erected the church building but to resign.</p>

<p class='c004'>The following, taken from a newspaper clipping,
shows what the separation meant to the church. The
writer, who merely signs with the initial D, states
that of the $5,000 already paid on the church, less
than $450 were paid by those who remained, while
some $4,500 were raised and paid by those “who, from
self respect, have been obliged to leave it”, and more
than two-thirds of the current expenses of the church
were also paid by them. Personally I am just enough
lacking in Christian charity to be pleased at the hole
the Eddyites found themselves in, but that has long
been a thing of the past and the bitter feeling then engendered
is so completely forgotten that one who was
in the front rank of the Eddyites can now say that
“Mr. Hine was Woodside”.</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_175'></a>
  <h4 class='c008'>A PARTISAN.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Mr. Daniel Halsey, who resided on Carteret street,
at one time did business in Petersburg, Va., and it became
the custom to have Mr. Halsey send to Petersburg
for a colored girl when any of his neighbors desired
such help; thus there was gradually formed a
small colony of Southern negroes, who were usually
intensely loyal to their employers. One of these, a
large, husky negress named “Milly”, was employed by
Rev. Mr. Eddy and thereby hangs a tale, as the story
books say.</p>

<p class='c004'>Shortly after the split in the Presbyterian Church,
and when the feeling was very bitter and the entire
neighborhood was divided into “Eddyites” and
“Hineites”, Mr. Hine had occasion to call on Mr.
Eddy for some purpose and was conducted by that
gentleman upstairs to his study.</p>

<p class='c004'>Two or three times during the interview Mr.
Eddy, who was an extremely nervous man, thought
he heard some one on the other side of the closed door
and, excusing himself, got up to look out into the hall,
but, seeing no one, resumed his seat. The conference
over, Mr. Hine was shown out, and as Mr. Eddy returned
to his study he saw standing in a niche near
the head of the stairs his colored Milly, with a flat-iron
in either hand and, as he approached she
brandished her weapons, shouting as she did so:
“Ah was ready for him! Ah was ready for him!” expecting,
of course, there was to be a fight and recognizing
her duty to her employer. Probably Mr. Hine
<a id='Page_176'></a>never knew how close he came that day to a broken
head.</p>

<p class='c004'>Milly was one of the impulsive sort and, so far as
her lights went, she lived up to them. Mrs. Perry
tells how, when she used to stand on the corner of
Lincoln and Elwood avenues, hesitating to engage
the sea of mud which lay between her and home, and
which was usually over shoe-top—the real, red, Jersey
mud—Milly, when she happened to spy her beloved
Sunday school teacher in this predicament, would
rush from the Eddy back door to the corner, pick up
the little woman, tuck her under her arm and carry
her across the street as a child might carry a doll. It
was of no use to resist; Milly was as large as a man
and as strong as two.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>PIONEERING IN WOODSIDE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>In these crude times many were the emergencies
that arose, and much ingenuity was called into play
to meet them, for between the Erie Railroad and that
farce known as the street car, Woodside was almost
as isolated as an island in mid ocean. Thus the making
of a mistake that in these days would be a trifle
was sometimes momentous in its consequences.</p>

<p class='c004'>This gave a certain pioneer flavor to the situation
and made of the community one great family where
neighbor was dependent on neighbor, and thus
brought out and developed character that the present
easy times do not call out, and men and women
loomed large or small as they actually deserved.</p>

<p class='c004'>One of the small-sized emergencies which arose
<a id='Page_177'></a>had to do with a certain Sunday morning communion
service in the Presbyterian Church, and the situation
was like this:—</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Cumming had made objection to the use of
wine at the communion, claiming that its very smell
was intoxicating and its influence bad, and the discussion
that followed led to a resolve to try unfermented
wine, which was then just beginning to be
introduced. As a consequence Mr. John Maclure, at
whose house the vessels used in the service were kept,
and who had charge of the preparations for the
service, made a special journey to New York to purchase
a bottle of the unfermented wine.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Margaret Perry, a daughter of Mr. Maclure,
tells how on the Sunday morning of this particular
communion service, while she was practising the
morning’s music on the church organ and her father
was preparing the communion table, she heard an
exclamation of surprise, and looked up to ascertain
the trouble.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Maclure was a Scotch Presbyterian, and was
necessarily limited in his Sunday morning vocabulary,
and there he stood in a momentary daze, and wholly
unable to fit words to the situation, with a quart bottle
in his hand which, instead of containing, as he had
supposed, unfermented wine, was full of Carter’s best
black ink. The clerk in New York had wrapped up
the wrong bottle.</p>

<p class='c004'>Imagine the desolation of the situation when, after
inquiring of Mr. Hall, rector of St. John’s, it was
<a id='Page_178'></a>learned that he had only just enough for his own communion
service, and there was no other where to turn,
for there was probably not a bottle of wine of any sort
in the small community.</p>

<p class='c004'>But here was demonstrated the pioneer readiness
to meet and conquer the unexpected. Mr. Maclure
gathered his family about him and all repaired to his
garden, where the grapes were just beginning to
ripen, and while some gathered others pressed the
fruit, and by straining the mass through cheesecloth
enough “unfermented wine” was secured to meet the
situation and save the day.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>PASTORS OF THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Following Mr. Eddy came Dr. James Evans, who
served for five or six years; then the Rev. James A.
Trimmer, four to five years; the Rev. Jos. W. Porter,
five to six years; the Rev. Henry C. Van der Beek,
who served nineteen years; during his pastorate the
church was moved to Forest Hill. The present incumbent
is the Rev. Frederick W. Lewis.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>SUNDAY SCHOOL IN THE ELLIOTT STREET SCHOOLHOUSE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Mr. Swinnerton writes that Mr. Hine did not favor
the suggestion that another Sunday school be started
when the subject was first proposed, as he was not
willing to do anything that would appear like opposition
or that might cause damage to his first love,
but there were sixty-odd children among the families
that had left the Presbyterian Church, and they were
soon clamoring for Mr. Hine. In the meantime the
<a id='Page_179'></a>trustees of the public school which had just been
erected on Cottage, now Elliott, street, Messrs. Albert
Beach, John C. Bennett and James Swinnerton, offered
the use of the building for Sunday school purposes,
and though Mr. Hine hesitated, they kept on
with the work of organization and, when he fully appreciated
the feeling, he yielded and, once his mind
was made up, took hold in good earnest.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>FORMATION OF CHRIST CHURCH OF WOODSIDE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The Sunday school was naturally followed by a
church organization, and the services of the Rev. John
M. Macauley, who was then living in Belleville, were
secured, Mr. Hine and Mr. E. A. Boyden being appointed
a committee for this purpose. As a burned
child dreads the fire, it was but natural that the first
thought was for a church organization independent
of all denominational control but, this not appearing
feasible, it was later decided that the Reformed Dutch
Church would satisfy the larger number, and that
denomination was adopted.</p>

<p class='c004'>The following, taken from the church books,
shows the method of procedure and gives the names
of those who were active:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“Woodside, N. J., May 16, 1871.</p>

<p class='c004'>“At a meeting held at the house of Mr. Charles C.
Hine, and composed of representatives from thirteen
families of the neighborhood, it was resolved to organize
a Church Society.</p>

<p class='c004'>“After reading of the scriptures and prayer being
<a id='Page_180'></a>offered by Revd. Dr. Macauley and Messrs. C. C.
Hine and H. H. Nichols, the meeting was formally
organized by the election of Horace H. Nichols as
Chairman and Jas. Swinnerton, Jr., as Secretary.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was then voted to organize without a denominational
name or connection, and on the standard of
belief of the Presbyterian Church, and it was also
decided, by a full vote, to call the Society ‘Christ
Church of Woodside’.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A committee composed of H. H. Nichols, C. C.
Hine, E. A. Boyden and Jas. Swinnerton, Jr., was
appointed to post the legal notice and arrange a
meeting for the election of officers, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The meeting then closed with prayer by Dr.
Macauley.</p>

the minutes of the first and second meetings were

was referred to a committee of three, consisting of
Dr. Macauley and Messrs. Beach and Blackwood,
for revision or amendment, who at once retired and,
after about fifteen minutes, returned.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dr. Macauley reported that the committee
thought the paper remarkably well drawn up, but
that they would suggest that the clause reading ‘that
<a id='Page_184'></a>repentance to-ward God, faith in the Lord Jesus
Christ and assistance from the Holy Ghost are sufficient
to cleanse us from our sins and restore us to
fellowship with our God’, be altered slightly in its
phraseology, which alteration would not materially
effect or change the meaning, as follows: ‘That
through repentance towards God, and faith in our
Lord Jesus Christ, by the grace of the Holy Ghost,
we may be cleansed from our sins and restored to
fellowship with our God’, which amendment being
accepted by Mr. Hine, this paper as amended was
adopted and reads as follows:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“In the fear of God and with a sincere desire to
promote the cause of Christ and our own growth in
the divine life, we do now enter into covenant with
God and with one another in the formation of a
Church to be known as ‘Christ Church of Woodside’,
the following being a brief summary of our belief.
We take the scriptures of the Old and New Testament
as the only rule of faith and practice; we
avouch the Lord Jehovah to be our God and portion
and the object of our supreme love and delight; the
Lord Jesus Christ to be our Saviour from sin and
death, our Prophet to instruct us, our Priest to atone
and intercede for us, and our King to rule over, project
and enrich us, and the Holy Ghost to be our
Sanctifier, Comforter and Guide.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Unto this Triune God—Father, Son and Holy
Ghost—we do without reserve and in a covenant
never to be revoked, give ourselves to be his willing
<a id='Page_185'></a>servants forever, and in humble reliance on the Lord
Jesus Christ we promise to discharge our several
duties, in the closet, in the family and in the community,
and also to attend upon the stated means
of Grace, the preaching of the Word and the ordinances
of Baptism and the Lord’s Supper.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We do humbly confess the total depravity of our
natures, the enmity of our hearts against God and
the manifold transgressions of our lives, but we believe,
nevertheless, that through repentance toward
God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, by the grace
of the Holy Ghost, we may be cleansed from our sins
and restored to fellowship with our God; and as a
further expression of our faith and belief we adopt
the creed commonly known as the Apostle’s Creed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We do bind ourselves by covenant to this
Church, to watch over it in the Lord, to seek its
peace and edification, to submit to the discipline of
Christ as here administered and to strive together
for the support and spread of the gospel of our
Saviour in all ways as opportunity may be given us,
relying only upon Him who is able to keep us from
falling and to present us faultless before the presence
of his glory with exceeding joy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Christ Church, Woodside, Newark, N. J., from
which the First Reformed Church of that place was
organized, held its first service of public worship in
the schoolhouse on the corner of the old Belleville
road and Cottage street, on the 19th of February,
1871, Rev. John M. Macauley, D. D., officiating. In
the following month—March 12, 1871—Dr. Ray
Palmer and Rev. Mr. Strieby preached; with this
single exception Dr. Macauley continued to preach
there for two years. During this time a call, signed
by every member of the church not absent from
home at the time, was tendered to Dr. Macauley to
become the regular pastor of the church.</p>

<p class='c004'>“In September, 1872, the question of a denominational
connection was decided in favor of the Reformed
(Dutch) Church and application was made
to the classis of Newark for admission. This application
met favorable consideration and a committee
consisting of Revs. E. P. Terhune, D. D., J. P.
Strong, D. D., C. E. Hart, and Elders A. C. Wheaton,
James Browe, was appointed to visit Woodside and
organize the church in accordance with the regulations
of classis.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Woodside, October 30, 1872.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The committee appointed by classis to organize a
Reformed Church at Woodside assembled for that
<a id='Page_187'></a>purpose Wednesday evening, October 30th, at the
schoolhouse. The exercises were opened by religious
services. Rev. Dr. J. P. Strong preached a sermon
from Psalm lxxxvii., 3d verse.</p>

<p class='c004'>“After these services the committee proceeded to
receive the members, thirty-two in number, applying
to be organized as a church.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The organization was completed by the election
of Horace H. Nichols, Charles C. Hine and Baxter
G. Blackwood as Elders, and James Swinnerton, Jr.,
Louis Dovell and E. A. Boyden as Deacons.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The following resolutions were adopted:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“Resolved, That the ordination of officers take
place on Sabbath, November 17, 1872.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Resolved, That the title of the church be ‘Christ
Church, The First Reformed Church, Woodside’.</p>

<p class='c004'>“November 17, 1872, after morning service, and in
pursuance of previous action, the ordination of the
officers elected October 30th was taken up, Dr. Macauley
officiating. Mr. Boyden having declined to act
as Deacon, Messrs. Dovell and Swinnerton were duly
ordained to that office, and Messrs. Blackwood,
Nichols and Hine as Elders.”</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Christ’s Church, Washington And Delevan Avenues. The first building of this congregation and the third church to be organized in the house of Mr. C. C. Hine. Note the horse cars.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>During the summer of 1872 arrangements had been
made for the erection of a neat chapel on an elevated
piece of ground on Washington avenue and work
on the same commenced. The building was completed
during the following Spring and worship was
begun therein on the 2d day of March, 1873. The
house was dedicated shortly afterward (March 9th),
<a id='Page_188'></a>Revs. Terhune, Strong, Abeel, Hart and the pastor,
Dr. Macauley, taking part in the services.  The
stained glass used in this building was a Woodside
production, made by George Laerter in a small place
in the neighborhood of Washington avenue and Halleck
street.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>DR. MACAULEY THE FIRST PASTOR OF CHRIST CHURCH.</h4>
<p class='c006'>On the 5th of March, 1873, at a meeting attended
by all the elders and deacons, it was resolved to repeat
the call to Dr. John M. Macauley, to become the
settled pastor of the church. A committee was then
appointed and instructed to proceed with that duty in
conformity with the usages of the Reformed Church.
The call was duly drawn up and, on the 31st of December,
1873, a meeting, moderated by Rev. Dr. J.
P. Strong, of Belleville, was held, at which the instrument
was completed and signed and ordered to be
placed in Dr. Macauley’s hands for approval prior to
presentation at the next regular meeting of classis.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>DR. JOHN M. MACAULEY.</h4>
<p class='c006'>On May 3, 1874, Dr. Macauley was installed pastor
of the church. The Doctor was a man of rare education,
a delightful companion with a brilliant mind
and a forceful and graceful method of speaking; a
pulpit orator of the old school, trained in gesture,
word and manner as well as mind. Will Cumming, of
the River road, then a young man studying law, and
himself unusually clever, used to come regularly to
the Sunday morning service in order to study the
<a id='Page_189'></a>Doctor’s polished manner and language. The Doctor
was one of the very few who could preach a long
sermon and hold the close attention of his audience
to the last word.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>TWO UNMENTIONABLES.</h4>
<p class='c006'>After the Doctor came two who covered a period
extending from 1881 to 1894, and concerning whom
little that is agreeable can be recorded. However a
search of the church records shows that on December
8, 1888, a bill for fertilizing the church lawn was
submitted by the pastor and ordered paid; thus we
see that his labors were not all in vain. During this
period the church building was moved from No. 215
Washington avenue to the present location and a parsonage
was erected in the rear.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>REV. ISAAC VAN WART SCHENCK.</h4>
<p class='c006'>As is well known it is easier to get an old man of
the sea on one’s back than to get rid of him, but the
spell was finally broken when, on August 13, 1894, a
call was extended to the Rev. Isaac Van Wart
Schenck, who proved to be the opposite in every respect
of his two predecessors. Mr. Schenck was a
whole-souled man who always gave his best to the
church and he was greatly beloved by Mr. Hine.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is interesting to note that the first trolley car
ran through Woodside on the first Sunday that Mr.
Schenck preached in the church.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>REV. HENRY MERLE MELLEN.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Mr. Schenck was succeeded by the Rev. Henry
Merle Mellen in September, 1900, and, under his administration,
<a id='Page_190'></a>the present church edifice was erected,
the success of this enterprise being largely due to Mr.
Mellen’s exertions.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<a href='images/christ-church-2-large.jpg'><img src='images/christ-church-2.jpg' alt='Christ Church, Washington And Delevan Avenues.' class='ig001' /></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Christ’s Church, Washington And Delevan Avenues. The second church edifice of this congregation. Erected 1906-7.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>On December 6, 1903, the mortgage of $1,900 on
the old church property was burned and the church
cleared of all indebtedness.</p>

<p class='c004'>February 4, 1904, the question of erecting a new
church edifice was publicly discussed by the congregation,
and the minister was instructed to appoint a
building committee of twenty members.</p>

<p class='c004'>March 10, 1904, the building committee met and
organized with Judge Alfred F. Skinner as chairman,
William B. Abbey as secretary, and George S. Bruen
as treasurer. It was decided to limit the cost of building
and furnishings to $25,000.</p>

<p class='c004'>April 29, 1905, Charles G. Jones of Belleville was
selected as architect.</p>

<p class='c004'>March 20, 1906, it was decided to move the old
building to the back of the lot.</p>

<p class='c004'>April 12, 1906, ground was broken for the new
building.</p>

<p class='c004'>June 14, 1906, the corner stone was laid under the
auspices of the Classis of Newark.</p>

<p class='c004'>January 20, 1907, the new church was opened for
worship.</p>

<p class='c004'>January 21, 1907, the building was dedicated.</p>

<p class='c004'>Memorial windows to the memory of Mr. C. C.
Hine and Mrs. Mary H. Hine, to Mrs. Anna W. Hine
and to the parents of Mr. Mellen, the minister, were
placed in the building.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_191'></a>The cost of the new church complete was a trifle
over $46,000.</p>

<p class='c004'>This brief outline by no means tells the story. As
before stated, the inception of the church is due to
the Rev. Henry Merle Mellen, and the raising of
money was also largely due to Mr. Mellen’s activity
and unselfish devotion to the cause. The building
committee was more than fortunate in its chairman
and members, and the result of their work is an ornament
to the locality.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>INCIDENTS OF THE EARLY DAYS OF THE CHURCH.</h4>
<p class='c006'>During the very early days of the church on the
hill, sexton Budd introduced his patent gasoline lamps
for lighting purposes, and no doubt was proud of his
accomplishment, but why the crazy things did not
blow up the first time they were lighted is the chief
mystery of the situation. As nearly as we can recall
the outfit consisted of the ordinary glass font with
a small metal tube at the top through which the vapor
arose, which gave light when a match was applied.
These did not stay long, for Mr. Hine, who was an
insurance man, very shortly discovered their possibilities.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lighting of Christ Church was first accomplished
with kerosene lamps, there being no gas in
the neighborhood then, except that made on the
premises of Mr. Hine for his own house. It occurred
to that gentleman that he could attach the church
(which then stood on the lot adjoining his home)
<a id='Page_192'></a>to that same gas machine, and thus do away with the
dim and troublesome kerosene burners.</p>

<p class='c004'>The idea was good, but the pumping machinery
which forced the flow of gas through the pipes was
inadequate for the extra work and, as a result, the
pump must be wound up by hand two or three times
during a Sunday evening. This usually fell to the lot
of the small boys who did not go to evening service,
they being strictly charged to visit the cellar every
thirty minutes or so and do the necessary work; but
small boys had a way of getting sleepy in those days,
and there is a tradition that Mr. Hine, being warned
by the gradual dimming of the lights, had to leave the
church in a great hurry occasionally and operate the
pump himself.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE CHURCH CHOIR.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Mr. Hine was musical to his finger tips and found
great enjoyment in the practice of the art. In his
youth he composed a number of songs and ballads
which were published in St. Louis. Naturally he had
charge of the church music, and among the pleasantest
experiences of his life were the choir rehearsals, and
particularly was this the case when Mr. Jay Ten Eyck
presided at the organ and the quartet choir consisted
of Mrs. F. W. Schmidt, Mrs. Dr. J. E. Janes, Mr. Harrison
I. Norton and Mr. Hine. One who knew him
well at that time has said that “he was just like a boy
going to a ball game when he came down to the
church on choir rehearsal nights”, such was his enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_193'></a>The selection and preparation of special music for
Easter and other occasions gave him the most keen
delight. At such times he would come home with an
armful of carols and spend evening after evening trying
them, usually with his flute, his daughter-in-law
being at the piano. The possibilities were then taken
up by the choir and the resulting music was reasonably
good, though considerable good natured fun was
poked at the choir-master on one occasion, at least,
when, after having labored earnestly over a long
Easter Sunday anthem the domine immediately began
his prayer with, “Oh, Lord, we thank Thee that
it is finished”.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Hine was notably successful with the Sunday
school music, having a peculiar faculty for arousing
the enthusiasm of children. His “Now, children!”
brought prompt and complete attention from all, and
he was so absorbed himself in the work and was so
much a part of it that the children abandoned themselves
to his sway and responded with a gusto that
made the singing of the school a great feature.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>WOODSIDE, 1868-9.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Woodside was set off from Belleville in 1868 and
lasted as an independent town just about two years.
Again I fall back on Mr. Swinnerton, who was town
clerk both years, for details. He says:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“When the new element came it found a lot of old-timers,
very glad to welcome us and to benefit by
the church and Sunday school privileges, but unwilling
<a id='Page_194'></a>to spend any money for street or sidewalk betterment.
Belleville contained many of the same sort,
but there were some there who helped us secure our
set-off into a township.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The village had scarce gained its independence,
however, when it was saddled with a heavy debt in
the shape of bonds for the Midland (now Greenwood
Lake) Railroad. This made it imprudent to attempt
the raising of money for local improvements, but
the year Mr. Hine was on the Town Committee $4,000
was raised for street improvements and divided
between the five districts of River road, Washington
avenue, Back road, Bloomfield road and the cross
road in Woodside. Mr. Hine spent $600 in making
a gravel walk from the cemetery to Carteret street,
and gave the remaining $200 to General Cumming
for use on the Gully road.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_196'></a>“Our portion went to Soho (which appears to
have been then a part of Woodside). The others
stirred the ground a little, leaving the mud as deep
as ever.” Woodside was an awful mud-hole in wet
weather.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Town Committee met at night, usually in the
house of Mr. Swinnerton, Town Clerk; none but the
town officers attended these meetings. The two annual
town meetings were held in a small hall on Washington
avenue, opposite the Morrison &amp; Briggs carpenter
shop; this hall burned later. Two or three
informal meetings were held in a small carpenter shop
standing in Mr. Swinnerton’s yard, on the northeast
corner of Elwood and Lincoln avenues (this was the
first Morrison &amp; Briggs shop). Here Woodside was
given its present name.</p>

<p class='c004'>So far as can now be recalled the Town Committeemen
were General Cumming, for the River road;
Mr. Hine, for Washington avenue; either Mr. Phillips
or Mr. Faitoute, for Lincoln avenue; Charles Akers,
for the Bloomfield road; “a fine, old Irish gentleman
for Soho”, and Joseph Dowling for the cross street.
James S. Gamble was Treasurer.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>A WOODSIDE TRAGEDY.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Possibly the only tragedy connected with Woodside
was the shooting of Albert D. Richardson on
December 2, 1869. Mr. Richardson was a celebrated
newspaper correspondent and an author of some note.
He had traveled over a large part of the United States
<a id='Page_197'></a>and had settled in Woodside because of its rural
beauty, having purchased the house built by Miles
I’Anson, which now stands on Summer avenue, facing
Chester.</p>

<p class='c004'>A Mrs. McFarland, who was later known to literature
as Abbie Sage Richardson, and who came of a
good Boston family, married Daniel McFarland, the
black sheep of a prominent New York family, and,
after supporting him for a reasonable length of time,
she secured a divorce. Mr. Richardson assisted her
in establishing herself, and about this time McFarland,
while under the influence of liquor, met him in
the office of the Tribune and shot him down. Richardson
was removed to the Astor House and lived for
a week. He was a widower with three young children
and, desiring Mrs. McFarland to look after them,
he married her while on his deathbed.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>WOODSIDE AND THE STREET CAR.</h4>
<p class='c006'>From the beginning and up to comparatively recent
times Woodside has been compelled to make a
continuous fight for proper street car service.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first car track laid extended from the cemetery
to Orange street, where it met the track which
had been laid in 1862 from Market street. There was
but one car, and that was pivoted on the trucks so
that, a king bolt being drawn, the body of the car was
swung around while the trucks remained on the track—this
instead of reversing the horses to the other end
of the car, as was done later. About 1865 the tracks
<a id='Page_198'></a>were extended north through Woodside to Second
river, to what was then known as “Flanigan’s station”,
and for six years they went no further.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was many years before the Woodside section
was treated as part of the main line, all sorts of bob-tail
excuses being offered us. Cars would come as
far as the “Pump” (cemetery), and there passengers
could wait for the “bob-tail” or walk as they saw
fit. There was no shelter against the winter’s storm
or shade from the summer sun. “Old Mose”, who
watered the horses at the pump, which stood just
about where the Washington avenue sidewalk on the
west now ends, was possessed of a movable bench
which followed the shadows of the trees as the sun
made its daily progress through the heavens, and this
was the only spot whereon to rest our weary bones
while waiting. Mose was a good natured old soul
whom every one liked, and was as much of an institution
as was the old West-farm pump from which he
drew the water for the horses. His “Now, William,
let her propel”, when it was time for a car to start,
became a by-word.</p>

<p class='c004'>Naturally those living in Woodside were always
grumbling at the poor car service furnished, and there
was a constant fight with Mr. Battin, and later with
Mr Barr, and many a delegation descended on the
Board of Aldermen, and almost invariably its head
and front was Mr. Hine who, while he loved peace,
did not believe in peace at any price. The company’s
<a id='Page_199'></a>charter required that all cars should run to the city
line (Second river), and Mr. Hine, with his wonted
energy, at once inaugurated an active campaign by
writing to the papers as well as stirring up the City
Fathers, and by dint of his “sticktoitiveness”, as he
called it, he won his point and the octopus was forced
to loose his tentacles and be subject to the law governing
its agreements.</p>

<p class='c004'>In this connection a friend writes concerning Mr.
Hine: “I remember, of course, his prominence in our
town meetings and meetings after Woodside became
annexed to Newark. He was the best speaker by
far in our section, and better versed in parliamentary
rules, so that he kept the meetings in better order
than they would otherwise have been. He had a great
faculty of leading people to state their views, thus
getting a subject well ventilated and adding much
interest to a meeting. In consequence of his great
ability for speaking he was always chosen leader of
our citizens’ delegations whether to the City Fathers
for better horse car facilities, or to the Erie Railroad
officials for improvements on that ‘system’.”</p>
<h4 class='c008'>NOTES ON MR. HINE’S CHARACTER.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Mr. Hine’s character was of a grade not often met
with. I was with him probably more than any one
else, as for many years we came and went together
morning and night and were closely associated during
business hours, and I can in all truth say that never
once have I heard him utter a word, even by implication,
<a id='Page_200'></a>that could not have been uttered in any presence,
nor did I ever hear him gossip of his neighbors
nor offer a criticism of any one not present except
once, and that was so gentle that, had it come from
another, it would have passed unnoticed. In this one
case he referred to an erratic genius who played the
church organ for many years, and who sorely tried
his patience.</p>

<p class='c004'>But it must not be supposed that because of his
gentle ways Mr. Hine could not fight. Nothing could
stop him when a sense of duty impelled; not even the
fear of death—if he ever had any such fear. As an
instance: When traveling for the Ætna Insurance
Company Mr. Hine, shortly after his marriage, and
when a wife and baby were dependent on him, was
sent to a town in Arkansas to establish an agency for
the company, being instructed to select a certain man
if he was found to qualify.</p>

<p class='c004'>They met and Mr. Hine, being satisfied, gave the
man his commission as agent, but during the following
evening he discovered that his new appointee had
celebrated by getting drunk, and immediately concluded
to take up the agency. Those acquainted with
the man, however, insisted that he do nothing of the
sort, stating that his agent was a fire eater, who would
accept it as a personal insult and would shoot.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Hine believed that only a coward carried arms
and never did so himself, though he had been much
in the Southwest and recognized the small value put
<a id='Page_201'></a>on life (this was about 1857 or 8). However he saw
what he believed was his duty and, while admitting
later that he faced the man with considerable fear of
the consequences, he did face him, and as briefly and
with as little sting as possible, stated his reasons for
withdrawing the commission. Strange to say the
“fire-eater” acknowledged the justice of the move and
expressed himself as sincerely sorry at the outcome.
Only the highest class of courage can compel a man
to face such a situation.</p>

<p class='c004'>I once by chance heard him tell an individual himself
that he was either a knave or a fool, but neither
knew that the remark was overheard, and Mr. Hine
never again spoke of the matter so far as I know. He
could tell the man himself, if necessity demanded it,
but would never speak of it to others.</p>

<p class='c004'>His contempt for money, except for the good it
could be made to do, was genuine and deep seated.
His charities, considering his limited income, were
boundless, as evidenced by his check stubs after his
death. An examination of these showed merely that
the $50 or $100 had gone to “an old friend”, or were
marked with the one word “charity”. While in many
cases money thus handed out was ostensibly loaned,
Mr. Hine early learned never to expect its return, and
he was seldom disappointed. One of his pet aphorisms,
“gratitude is a lively sense of favors to come”,
was frequently applied to this situation.</p>

<p class='c004'>The fact that he was imposed on and defrauded by
<a id='Page_202'></a>charity fakirs time and again never made any difference;
the next time he would take chances rather
than run the risk of not helping where help was
needed. He often said that “he could swallow anything
he could get through his shirt collar”, and his
shirt collar was a mighty easy affair, as many “a
friend in need” discovered.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the other hand, no matter how much it might
curtail his income by antagonizing a customer, he
would hit every head in sight if he thought it deserved
it, and he knew how to hit—none better. He had a
way of grasping a situation and clarifying its follies
or crooked features that was at times merciless.</p>

<p class='c004'>As before stated, Mr. Hine’s opportunities for
school education were limited in his youth. On the
other hand, his knowledge was almost universal.
How he kept abreast of the times as he did was a
mystery, even to his own family, for he had no time
to read, beyond his morning and evening paper between
home and office. His evenings, when not filled
with church matters, were largely taken up by those
who were ever calling on him for help and who never
went away without receiving the best he had to give,
whether they were young or old, or the poorest of the
poor. He would explain a matter to a child with as
much courtesy and patience as to an adult.</p>

<p class='c004'>On one occasion when he was confined to the house
with some slight indisposition a small girl appeared
at the back door with a straggling bunch of field flowers
<a id='Page_203'></a>in her hand and handed it in with the simple message,
“Tell Mr. Hine that I love him”. Hardly anything
could have touched the recipient more deeply,
and yet that small girl voiced a sentiment that was almost
universal among those who knew him best.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Hine was as punctilious in doing for his own
boys as for the church, and while he believed in making
them earn those things they desired, that they
might the more fully appreciate them, he always stood
by his agreements, not only in letter but in spirit.
His idea seems to have been to make the boy feel satisfied
that he had been given a square deal. Possibly
one or two small instances will do no harm here:—</p>

<p class='c004'>One of the boys once saw a velocipede in a Newark
store that he thought he wanted, and began to
save his money for that purpose. As I recollect it,
the machine was to cost $12. In the meantime the
father saw one in New York for $10 that looked to
him just as good, and told the youngster about it,
and announced that he would bring it out. On arrival
it proved to be a size or two smaller—a $10 size—and
the boy was disappointed, but instead of telling him it
was just as good, he seemed to get down to the lad’s
level and appreciate that it was a matter of importance
to him, and he made good without a hint of
grumble at the extra trouble involved in taking the
machine back and bringing out the larger one, and he
paid the added $2 himself. He had said he could get
one just as good for less money. He seemed to expect
<a id='Page_204'></a>no particular thanks, merely giving the impression
that he was only doing what he had agreed to do.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Hine’s eldest was probably born with a streak
of tar in his composition, for he has been an ancient
mariner ever since I first knew him. No sooner was
the boy large enough to run around a bit than he
wanted a row boat on the river; but his father
promptly responded to such a proposition with, “No,
young man; not until you can swim across the river”,
evidently in the belief that this was still some seasons
off. But the lad wanted the boat, and the moment he
could stand the temperature he was in the river, and
generally several times a day (his mother never suspected
how often), and by hard work and much persistence
he managed to get the hang of the thing long
before the summer was out, and one day announced
that he could swim across the river and wanted the
boat.</p>

<p class='c004'>Naturally his father was a bit incredulous, but
they went to the water’s edge, and while the elder
hired a boat at the Point House, the son retired to
the privacy of the Melius dock and stripped for the
ordeal. His clothes were put in the boat and the two
started, and you can be sure that the father kept close
by in case of accident, but there was none, and the boy
got across all right. Then his father asked if he
could swim back, and he said he would try, and did.</p>

<p class='c004'>No sooner were his clothes on again than he said:
“Now, can I have that boat?” and quite as promptly
<a id='Page_205'></a>came the answer, “Yes; we will go down town now
and get it”. There was no quibbling or hesitation or
delay, and no matter how the father may have felt in
allowing his small son to have a boat, he had given
his word and that settled it, and within the hour the
lad was rowing up the river in his own boat, as proud
as any small boy could be and without any idea of the
situation except that both parties to the bargain had
lived up to it.</p>

<p class='c004'>His methods of punishment were usually well
fitted to the occasion. I still recall one instance with
a clarity of vision that omits no detail. Mr. Hine was
left in charge of the Winser premises during the absence
of that family in Europe and, during that portion
of the year when “sling shots” are in vogue, a
group of young highwaymen, of which the younger
two hopefuls of the Hine family were members,
thought it was fine fun to sling stones between the
blinds of the Winser house, then vacant, and hear the
glass smash. But one day Mr. Hine discovered what
was going on, and appointed himself a committee of
one to investigate. He made no fuss whatever—just
said we would have to replace the glass. It made no
difference that others besides ourselves had helped in
the mischief; if the others would help to pay for it
that was all right, but none of his affair. Of course
few of the other boys could see the thing from our
point of view, and it took just about all of our little
hoard, which had almost reached the point where we
<a id='Page_206'></a>could purchase a greatly desired printing press, to
pay for the damage. It was a cruel blow, but we
never broke any more glass.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Hine, just as a matter of course, did any little
thing he could for friend or neighbor; it never occurred
to him to hesitate when he saw the opportunity.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the matter of a station agent was first being
agitated for the Woodside stop on the Newark branch
of the Erie, one who thought he wanted the job fixed
up a petition and went to the depot one morning to
secure the signatures of such commuters as he knew.
Seeing Mr. Hine and hoping for his name to head the
list, he offered the paper to him, asking that he sign
it if he approved. After reading Mr. Hine not only
signed, but himself took the paper to every man present
and insisted that each one sign, responding to
those who objected that they did not know the young
man, that he did, and had known him almost all his
life, and knew he was safe to indorse. The result was
that twice as many signatures were secured from that
group as were hoped for. It was a small thing, but
the prompt and hearty way in which it was done
made it a benediction, and that man still thinks of
Mr. Hine with pleasure and likes to tell why.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>MRS. MARY HAZARD AVERY HINE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Mrs. Mary Hazard Avery Hine was born in
Westport, Conn., January 29, 1821. Her parents removed
to the West when she was a young woman,
<a id='Page_207'></a>and she met Mr. Hine in St. Louis, Mo., and there
married him. Mrs. Hine was educated in New Haven,
receiving the best schooling which that city could
give a girl eighty odd years ago, and she grew up under
favoring circumstances. She was a woman of fine
mind and great breadth and strength of character, and
a recognized leader.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Hine was the third president of the Y. W. C.
A. of Newark, and remained at its head through the
many trying years of its youth, and when it was a
very different institution from the present and very
differently managed. She was also for many years
president of the New Jersey branch of the Women’s
Indian Association, and one of its most active members.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nearer home she organized and conducted a
Zenana Mission Band which, in itself, would have
been considered work enough by most women and,
in addition, she carried on a large Bible class in the
Sunday school—all this without interfering in the
least with her household duties, which she was slow
to delegate to others.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>THE ZENANA MISSION BAND.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The Zenana Mission Band, which was started by
Mrs. Hine, became quite an institution, with its bi-weekly
meetings and annual fair, which were held in
the home at 209 Washington avenue. Just when it
was begun, or how, I am unable to state, but it was
many years ago, and the meetings were only stopped
<a id='Page_208'></a>when advancing years compelled Mrs. Hine to give
up the responsibility.</p>

<p class='c004'>The meetings began early in the fall and lasted
the day out. These continued until a fair was given
during the following May or June, at which time the
entire lower floor of the house was stripped of its
furniture and devoted to the event. Tables and
booths for the sale of all manner of articles, from embroidery
to ice cream, being erected in every available
corner.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Hine designed the embroidery patterns used
and both she and Miss Avery, being expert with the
needle, began the pieces and set the pace for the
others, they having been brought up at a time when
household duties and the finer uses of the needle were
a part of every girl’s education. Some of those with
whom I have talked look on the educational value to
those who came to these meetings as possibly the
more important feature, believing that many of the
young women who attended would never otherwise
have had their taste and skill for such work developed,
for the embroidery was most rich and elaborate, requiring
exceedingly careful manipulation.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the fair fell on rainy times and the fancy
goods did not go off as desired Miss Avery would take
a bundle of the best to New York and there dispose
of the articles among her friends, for just about so
much money was wanted to send out to India each
year, and if it did not come it must be gone after.</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_209'></a>
  <h4 class='c008'>MISS JANE A. AVERY.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>In this connection I cannot forbear from a brief
word concerning Miss J. A. Avery, Mrs. Hine’s sister
and aid in all good works. Miss Avery was one
of the most lovable persons I have ever met, her self-sacrificing
spirit and constant thought of others being
most marked. And with a saintly spirit she had an
attractive personality quite beyond the ordinary.</p>

<p class='c004'>She has been compared to a bit of delicate Sevres
china, and possibly that is as good a comparison showing
her daintiness as could be made, but Miss Avery
was something more than merely attractive; her devotion
to any duty in hand was such that she never
had a thought of fear, nor did she allow the discomfort
of pain to interfere. Before the day of trained
nurses she was caring for an uncle—Judge Edward
Avery of Massillon, Ohio—who required constant attention,
and while so engaged the bones of one foot
were crushed by the falling of a heavy iron. The
doctor insisted that she must not stand on this foot,
but this injunction she felt it was impossible to obey,
and made that same doctor whittle out a thin board
and bind it to the injured foot, and thus she hobbled
about in constant pain, but giving the unremitting attention
required by her patient.</p>

<p class='c004'>One who knew Miss Avery well for many years
writes that she “was one of those rare characters whose
mission it is to bring comfort and cheer to their fellows.
She was one of those large natures of whom
<a id='Page_210'></a>Goethe says, ‘They impress not by what they do,
but by what they are’.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wherever she went she was welcome; she had
the remarkable faculty of seeing at a glance what
was needed, and without a word doing the right
thing, the wonderful gift of tact which, with a loving
nature, makes the possessor a tower of strength.
So winning was her personality that she made friends
wherever she went, and always said laughingly that
she could travel all over Europe with only her
mother-tongue.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It is impossible at this date to go into details concerning
all those who were active during the early
days of this period, but there are a few in regard to
whom I have been able to secure some bits of information.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>MR. HORACE H. NICHOLS.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Mr. Horace H. Nichols was a man who left his
impress on all those who came in contact with him.
Mr. Nichols was a carpenter and builder in Newark
before his removal to Woodside. He secured the contract
for fencing the cemetery and that brought him
this way, and the beauties of the country gave him
a longing to turn farmer, and so he bought a considerable
tract here in 1846, and in 1852 built the white
house which still stands back from the road. Here
he started the growing of fruit, and was very successful,
as many of us can testify.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Nichols had the character of a saint and,
<a id='Page_211'></a>while not an aggressive man, was always ready “to
dig down in his jeans” whenever the church called for
help, and was ever looking for the opportunity to do
his share—rather an unusual trait.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>REMINISCENCES OF MR. HENRY J. WINSER.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Mr. Henry J. Winser was not with us during
much of the very early period, owing to his appointment
as consul at Sonneberg, Germany, during the
eight years when Grant was President, and also
through the term of President Hayes, and he had little
opportunity for local activity.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Winser’s earliest experience in the War of the
Rebellion was as military secretary (with the rank of
first lieutenant) to Col. Elmer E. Ellsworth, whose
blood was the first shed in the war.</p>

<p class='c004'>The friendship with Ellsworth began in 1855 when
he came to New York, a youth of seventeen, from his
home in Saratoga County, hoping to be appointed as
cadet to West Point. In this, however, he was disappointed,
as the politicians desired the places for their
friends’ sons.</p>

<p class='c004'>He then began the study of law in Chicago, but
also kept up his study of the art of war and, becoming
impressed with the tactics of the French Zouaves
during the Crimean War, and being well known in
military circles in Chicago, it was an easy matter for
him to form a company. This was organized as the
Ellsworth Zouaves, and was composed of the flower
of the youth of Chicago.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_212'></a>The fame of the “Chicago Zouaves” had become
so widespread that a year or two before the war Ellsworth
was asked to bring his men East, and so great
was the enthusiasm over their exhibition that Colonel
Ellsworth’s methods were soon widely copied.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the time of Mr. Lincoln’s election to the
Presidency, Ellsworth was employed in his law office.
He accompanied him to Washington and remained
near the President during the unsettled period
which followed the inauguration. He was among the
first to obtain a military commission from President
Lincoln, and was sent to New York with instructions
to form a regiment from the ranks of the Volunteer
Fire Department of the city in the shortest possible
time.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Winser was impressed into the service on this
occasion. In a very short time Ellsworth had twelve-hundred
men enlisted and mustered into the service
of the United States under the call for three months’
volunteers, and in the extraordinarily brief period of
three weeks from the time he arrived in New York he
marched at the head of a thousand well-equipped men
to the steamship at the foot of Canal street. On
reaching Washington this body of raw recruits was
at first given quarters in the Capitol building, owing
to lack of camp equipage.</p>

<p class='c004'>There were many anomalous things connected
with the organization of the volunteer forces in the
early stages of the war, and not the least anomalous
<a id='Page_213'></a>was the fact that Ellsworth appointed Mr. Winser his
military secretary, with the rank and uniform of first
lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c004'>The advance into Virginia had been determined
upon and instructions were given to embark at two
o’clock in the morning for Alexandria. Ellsworth then
entered the tent which he and Mr. Winser shared and
asked the latter to get some sleep while he finished his
final arrangements. Then it was that he wrote that
brief, but pathetic letter to his parents which drew
tears from many unaccustomed eyes after it was published.
The letter is in an old scrapbook of Mr.
Winser’s, and reads as follows:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Headquarters First Zouaves,</div>
      <div class='line'>”Camp Lincoln, Washington, May 23, 1861.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“My dear Father and Mother:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“The regiment is ordered to move across the river
to-night. We have no means of knowing what reception
we shall meet with. I am inclined to the
opinion that our entrance to the city of Alexandria
will be hotly contested, as I am just informed that a
large force has arrived there to-day. Should this
happen, my dear parents, it may be my lot to be injured
in some manner. Whatever may happen, cherish
the consolation that I was engaged in the
performance of a sacred duty, and to-night, thinking
over the probabilities of the morrow and the occurrences
of the past, I am perfectly content to accept
whatever my fortune may be, confident that He who
<a id='Page_214'></a>noteth the fall of a sparrow will have some purpose
even in the fate of one like me. My darling and ever-loved
parents, good-bye. God bless, protect and care
for you.</p>

<p class='c004'>ELMER.“</p>

<p class='c004'>Just as daylight was breaking on the morning of
the twenty-fourth of May, the steamers carrying the
Ellsworth Zouaves arrived at Alexandria. The commander
of the sloop-of-war Pawnee, which lay off
Alexandria, had already proposed terms of submission
which had been accepted by the city, and it was supposed
that there would be no resistance to the occupation
of the town.</p>

<p class='c004'>The following is Mr. Winser’s account of what occurred:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ellsworth was the first to land, and then Company
E, Captain Leveridge, formed upon the wharf. Without
waiting for the remainder of the regiment to disembark
the Colonel gave some hurried instructions
for interrupting the railroad communication and,
calling to me, said: ‘Winser, come with me to the
telegraph office. It is important to cut the wires.’
Mr. E. H. House, correspondent of the New York
Tribune, had accompanied the expedition, and he and
the Rev. E. W. Dodge, chaplain of the regiment, who
were standing near, asked if they might go with us.
We had gone only a few paces when I suggested to
Ellsworth that perhaps it would be well to take a
squad of men as an escort. He assented at once and
I soon overtook him with a sergeant and four men
<a id='Page_215'></a>from Company A. We ran up the street for about
two blocks on a double-quick in the supposed direction
of the telegraph office, meeting a few sleepy-looking
people on the way. The Colonel at this moment
caught sight of a large Confederate flag which
had just been raised above the roof of a building apparently
two or three blocks distant to the left. He
at once said: ‘Boys, we must have that flag!’ and
told the sergeant to go back and tell Captain Coyle
to follow us with his entire company.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not heeding the mission to the telegraph office
for the moment, we pushed on toward the building
with the flag flying over it and found it was the
Marshall House, an hotel of second-class grade. As
we rushed into the open door the Colonel called out
to a man in shirt and trousers who was entering the
hallway from the opposite side: ‘What flag is that
over the roof?’ The fellow looked neither surprised
nor alarmed at the irruption of armed men, and answered,
doggedly as I thought: ‘I don’t know anything
about it; I am only a boarder here.’ Without
further parley the Colonel ran up the long winding
stairway to the topmost story, the rest of us following
closely. It did not take long to find the attic
room, whence opened a skylight with the flagstaff
within easy reach, and the large flag was soon upon
our heads.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I passed it down to the men below, and as I got
off the ladder I saw the Zouaves tearing off pieces as
<a id='Page_216'></a>mementos of the exploit. This I stopped, saying
that the flag must not be mutilated, but must be preserved
as a trophy. The entire occurrence could
not have occupied more than a couple of minutes. I
was busy rolling the long flag over my arm when
Ellsworth turned to the stairway holding one end of
the flag. He was preceded by Private Francis E.
Brownell, of Company A. Mr. House and Chaplain
Dodge were close beside him, and I was a few steps
behind, still rolling the flag on my arm as compactly
as possible. There were two men in the attic room
whom we had not noticed at first in our eagerness to
get down the flag. They arose in great bewilderment
to witness our deed and were almost fully dressed.
They had, however, no connection with the tragic
event.</p>

<p class='c004'>“In the order I have mentioned we began our descent
of the broad, winding stairway. My attention
was too much occupied in managing the bulky flag to
know by actual observation precisely what happened
in the first instant of the lamentable tragedy.
I heard the clash of weapons and at the same moment
the report of two guns, with so imperceptible
an interval between that it might have been taken
for a single shot. I saw Ellsworth fall forward at
the foot of the first flight of stairs, and I saw Brownell,
standing on the landing near the turn to the second
flight, make a thrust with his bayonet at the tottering
form of a man which fell headlong down half
the second flight of stairs. No explanation of what
<a id='Page_217'></a>had happened was needed. As Brownell reached the
first landing place, after the descent of a dozen steps,
a man rushed out and, without noticing the private
soldier, leveled a double-barreled gun squarely at
Ellsworth’s breast. Brownell said that he made a
quick pass to turn the gun aside, but was not successful,
and the contents of both barrels, slugs or
buckshot, entered the Colonel’s heart, killing him instantly.
He was on the third step above the landing
when he received the shot, and he fell forward in
that helpless, heavy manner which showed that every
spark of life had left his body ere he reached the
floor. The murderer’s fingers had scarcely pressed
the triggers of his weapon when Brownell’s rifle was
discharged full in the centre of his face, and as he
staggered to his fall the shot was followed by a bayonet
thrust of such force that it sent the man backward
down the upper section of the second flight of stairs,
where he lay for hours afterward with his face to
the floor and his rifle beneath him. This man proved
to be James T. Jackson proprietor of the Marshall
House, and I fully recognized him as the person we
had met as we entered the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We were dazed for a few seconds at the shocking
calamity, but we rallied, not knowing how soon we
should be called upon to defend our own lives. There
were only seven of us, and Mr. House was unarmed.
The noise and confusion of the last few moments
had aroused the sleepy household, and we saw that
<a id='Page_218'></a>in point of numbers we were in a small minority. I
stationed the three Zouaves at points commanding
the approaches to the passages converging on the
stairway where we stood, and directed that the first
man who showed himself in the passages should be
shot down. The occupants of the rooms in our immediate
vicinity were gathered together in a single
apartment and Brownell, who had reloaded his rifle,
was placed as guard over them with instructions to
shoot the first man who should evince a hostile disposition.
The Chaplain and I searched the story
above, finding only the two men whom I have before
mentioned as being in the attic room when the flag
was cut down; these we led down and put in
Brownell’s custody. Mr. House, meanwhile, had
kept watch that no one approached us from the story
below. These defensive measures were only the
work of a minute or two.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We next turned our attention to our dear friend,
the Colonel, whose life-blood had literally deluged
the hallway. If we had not been too sadly sure that
he was beyond the reach of any aid we could offer
there would not have been even the slight delay there
was ere we raised him from the floor. Mr. House and
I lifted him up tenderly and laid him upon the bed in
a room that was vacant. His uniform was so
drenched with blood that it was almost impossible
to discover the exact location of his wound. Unfastening
his belt and unbuttoning his coat we found
<a id='Page_219'></a>that the murderous charge had penetrated his left
breast, taking into the wound much of the clothing,
making a cavity almost large enough to insert a
clenched hand. Poor fellow! We washed the stains
from his face, which was beautiful in death—the expression
of the handsome features not at all changed,
except by the pallor, from that which his friends
knew so well in life, and we composed his body, over
which we laid the Confederate flag which had so long
waved in defiance within sight of the White House,
feeling that its use in this way purified it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The sword which Ellsworth wore at the time
of his murder was given to Mr. Winser and is still in
the possession of the family.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Winser was at the battle of Cold Harbor and
had his horse shot under him. After the battle, during
the night, a rifle ball lodged in the tent pole directly
over his head, so low down that it must almost have
passed through his hair, but so exhausted was he that
he was all unconscious that death had been so near.
During the Draft Riots in New York, in July, 1863,
Mr. Winser was in command of the battery which
protected Printing House Square. He also did effective
work in communicating with the authorities on
Governor’s Island, and although he was a marked
man owing to his connection with the New York
Times, he went fearlessly about the city looking after
his friends in the sections where a reign of terror had
set in.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_220'></a>Mr. Winser was once made prisoner of war by
Gen. Thomas W. Sherman, who was in command at
Beaufort, S. C. Mr. Winser had criticised his methods
in a letter to the Times. This so angered the General
that he caused his arrest, sending him on board the
Arago, which was just leaving for New York, without
permitting him to communicate with any of his
friends. The publication of the affair resulted in Mr.
Winser’s reinstatement at headquarters in South
Carolina.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Winser was with Farragut at New Orleans, as
a representative of the Times. In those days the
means of communication were exceedingly slow, and
Mr. Winser, recognizing the value to his paper of
such a “scoop” as the first news of this important
event would be, rowed down the Mississippi from
Fort Jackson to the Gulf, where he found a schooner
bound for Key West. This he boarded, and reached
his destination a few hours ahead of the steamer from
Havana, Cuba, which touched here for mail and passengers
on its way to New York.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus the New York Times had an account of the
bombardment and surrender of Forts Jackson and
Phillip three days in advance of any other journal.
This was considered the greatest “beat” ever known
in the history of journalism. It was not only the
means of giving the news to the country, but was
also the first intimation that the government itself received
of the success of the fleet. Mr. Winser returned
to New Orleans and was there during the Butler
<a id='Page_221'></a>regime and chronicled the General’s achievements
for his paper.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Winser was also present at the meeting of
Grant and Lee under the famous apple tree to arrange
for the surrender of the Confederate Army.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was one of the commissioners for the exchange
of prisoners from Andersonville, and his reports of the
condition of the men were most harrowing.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the famous Butler-Porter controversy occurred
in 1889, it was Mr. Winser who was able to
prove that Butler’s charges against Porter were untrue.</p>

<p class='c004'>When Mr. Winser sent his report of Farragut’s
passage of the forts below New Orleans (as narrated
elsewhere), fearing there might be a miscarriage, he
wrote a second account which was forwarded by the
same steamer that carried the letters of other newspaper
correspondents. This latter manuscript was returned
to him and hence, when Admiral Porter wrote,
asking him if he remembered the circumstances of the
sudden order from Captain Porter to the flotilla to
cease firing and return, Mr. Winser was able to give a
transcript of the affair from his manuscript letter.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a great grief to Mr. Winser that General
Butler should have placed himself in so unpleasant a
position, for he had valued him as a friend and soldier,
and was most reluctantly brought into the controversy.</p>

<p>Woodside As God Made It. Picture taken about 1885 from a Washington Avenue back yard. Looking south across the fields toward the Passaic.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>When he settled in Woodside Mr. Winser was city
<a id='Page_222'></a>editor of the Times and was deep in the investigation
of the Tweed Ring. This work was so exacting that
he had no time even to attend to his own private affairs,
and paid little attention to Woodside politics,
except in one instance.</p>

<p class='c004'>During the first year of Woodside’s independence
there were no politics; no salaries attached to any of
the offices, and consequently the good men were allowed
to fill them. But by the time the second annual
election approached there were a few soreheads who
joined themselves unto the scattering Democrats and
the house was divided against itself.</p>

<p class='c004'>This necessitated some electioneering, which was
undertaken by Mr. Winser and Mr. Theodore G.
Palmer, who went the rounds of the district canvassing
for votes. The result was overwhelmingly Republican
and eminently satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Winser broke down in January, 1869, and was
told by the doctors that he must stop night work.
He was advised by a friend to apply to General Grant
for a consular position, and Sonneberg was suggested
for its beauty of location and the wide field it offered
for consular and other work, as it was the largest consulate
in Germany.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. H. J. Raymond, of the New York Times, was
bitterly opposed to this and refused to help in any
way, declining even to write introductions to his political
friends in Washington or to request their aid
in the appointment. Mr. R. said: “I do not want
<a id='Page_223'></a>you to leave the Times and I shall in no way help you
in your desire.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But after Grant’s inauguration Mr. Winser wrote,
asking for the Sonneberg post, and his was the first
appointment made after March 4, 1869.</p>

<p class='c004'>Secretary of State Hamilton Fish was a friend of
Dr. Cox, father-in-law of Mr. Winser, and knew his
(Mr. Winser’s) record as a journalist, and this doubtless
was a help. Mr. Winser’s appointment was regarded
as most remarkable, in that politics and
pressure had nothing to do with it. Grant made it
because he was a personal friend and the State Department
probably sanctioned it because, in the application,
Mr. W. said that he spoke three languages
and referred to his Times editorials upon political
matters.</p>

<p class='c004'>While consul at Sonneberg Mr. Winser was appointed
by the United States Government, Commissioner
to the World’s Fair at Vienna in 1873.</p>

<p class='c004'>When Mr. Winser returned from Sonneberg in
1873, intending to resign, Mr. Fish urged him to reconsider
his decision and return to his post to go on
with the work he had done for the government.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Winser was the first American officer to look
into the emigration from Germany. He stopped the
deportation of criminals from Germany to this country.
He was the first man to study the forestry system
in Germany, the consulate being in the centre of
the forestry department of the country. Knowing the
<a id='Page_224'></a>language thoroughly and being persona grata in high
official circles he had access to all departments.</p>

<p class='c004'>He wrote a most exhaustive report on the “Forests
and Forest Culture of Thuringia”, which was sent to
the State Department on November 28, 1873, and is
in the “Commercial Relations” of 1873. So valuable
was this report deemed by the State Department that
it was printed as a separate pamphlet and sent to
every newspaper in the country. In his report Mr.
W. urged upon this country the necessity of cultivating
and preserving its forests, as the time would come
when care would be needed for their conservation
from an economic point of view, for the supply of
timber and for the effect they produced upon the
climate, rainfall, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'>The press of this country, one and all, hailed the
report with derision, it being regarded as ridiculous
that this great country with its primeval forests and
its vast area of timber land could ever be depleted.
Even the Times feared that Mr. Winser’s four years’
residence in a little country like Germany had
dwarfed his ideas.</p>

<p class='c004'>Twenty years later when the country became
alarmed concerning the fearful devastation then going
on throughout its forests men were rushed to
Germany to learn its art of forestry.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Winser sent the government the first translation
of the new German tariff. It was received from
the Coburg Minister of State within an hour after
<a id='Page_225'></a>he received it from the Imperial Government, and
permission to keep it for twenty-four hours was
given. At 9 a. m. Mr. and Mrs. W. sat down, after
giving directions that they were not to be disturbed,
and at 8 p. m. the work was finished, they dividing
the pamphlet book in half and each working independently
of the other. This feat created a sensation
at the State Department and at the Consulate General
at Frankfort. Mr. Winser had taken the precaution
to notify the State Department that the voluminous
matter had left Coburg on a certain date. He also
wrote the Consul General, through whose office all
documents were forwarded, that he had done this, so
that no detention could be possible on the way. It
was a fortunate thing that this was done, as the Consul
General wrote he was sorry that he could not
keep the document for a few days that he might get
“some points”. He wanted to know how it was possible
for Mr. W. to obtain the law before it had been
given to the public.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Winser also sent the first translation of the
new laws concerning the Rinderpest to the government.</p>

<p class='c004'>On Mr. Winser’s return from Germany he was appointed,
by Mr. Henry Villard, Chief of the Bureau of
Information of the Northern Pacific Railway. In this
capacity he inspected all the country tributary to the
railroad, writing many pamphlets on the resources of
the far West. He also wrote concerning the Yellowstone
Park and its wonders.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_226'></a>He was in charge of the foreign guests at the celebration
of driving the last spike of the railroad. Later
he became assistant editor of the Commercial Advertiser,
and then became managing editor of the Newark
Daily Advertiser. Just before his death he prepared
the history of Trinity Church, Newark, on the occasion
of the sesqui-centennial celebration. For nine
years he was clerk of the vestry.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Winser was one of the charter members of the
“Monks of the Passaic”, a literary organization affiliated
with the “Monks of the Meerschaum” in Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Winser, Mr. Noah Brooks and Prof. Byron
Matthews organized “The Wednesday Club”, which
has become one of the best-known literary clubs of
Newark. He was a life member of the New Jersey
Historical Society.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Winser’s church and other connections in
Woodside are referred to elsewhere.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>MR. JAMES SWINNERTON.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Mr. James Swinnerton, to whom I owe more
than to any other one man for material covering this
period, was a member of Swinnerton Bros., manufacturing
jewelers in Newark. He removed to Woodside
in 1866, being one of the very first of the new
element.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Swinnerton immediately assumed a prominent
place in the community, being town clerk during
both the years of local independence and taking a foremost
<a id='Page_227'></a>position in church and Sunday school development.
So well satisfied were the voters with his work
as town clerk that, when the second annual election
was held, and an opposition ticket was put in the
field, he received 185 of the 192 votes cast for that
office.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Swinnerton has a natural antiquarian bent
and, as a consequence, has preserved many memorials
and a vivid memory of the past, and such of these as
relate to Woodside he has freely put at my disposal,
throwing light into many a dark corner.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>MR. ALBERT BEACH.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Mr. Albert Beach was born in Newark and moved
to the Bartholf farm on the old Bloomfield road about
1865. He was a kindly man and had a number of boys
who were always ready to help along any mischief in
which we were interested, and as Mr. Beach himself
was much interested in the church we were quite
neighborly, boy and man. And then all boys appreciated
Mrs. Beach, who was one of those who sensed
the fact that a boy’s heart lay next his stomach, and
who immediately established close relations with
both. The Beach house was overrun with boys a
goodly portion of the time, and they were not all
Beach boys, either.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>GEN. GILBERT W. CUMMING.</h4>
<p class='c006'>General Gilbert W. Cumming lived on the River
road in the old Stimis house. The General’s property
came down to the swamp where we boys learned
<a id='Page_228'></a>to skate, and his rail fence was a great temptation
when a fire was wanted, which was mostly all the
time. It is still well remembered how, on such occasions
he would come charging down the hill “spitting
blue sparks”. The General’s habit of language was acquired
in the army, apparently, and it generally
sounded as though the army was in Flanders at the
time; certainly it was of the pyrotechnic order, and
no one could well blame him with such an inciting
firebrand as his rail fence became. He was a thoroughly
good man, however, and while he had the
reputation of being somewhat crusty and quick tempered,
he could be quite genial when all things
worked together for peace. “He was an old-fashioned
lawyer of the Abe Lincoln school.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The General was born March 12, 1817, of Scotch
parents, at Stamford, N. Y. He was admitted to the
bar in New York, but removed to Chicago in 1858.
When the Civil War broke out he offered his services
and was appointed Colonel of the 51st Illinois Volunteers,
which he was largely instrumental in raising.</p>

<p class='c004'>Under General Pope he participated in the battle
of New Madrid, Mo., and while in charge of a brigade
on the way to Tiptonville his capture of Island No.
10 against great odds brought him prominently to the
front. For this he was made a brigadier-general for
“gallant and meritorious services at Island No. 10”.</p>

<p class='c004'>Proceeding to Tiptonville he assisted in the capture
of 6,000 Southern soldiers and later took part with his
<a id='Page_229'></a>brigade in the attack on Fort Pillow. He was also at
Corinth and Shiloh and was brought home from the
latter on a cot, his breakdown being due to hard work
and exposure. During a long rainy period he regarded
himself as fortunate if he had a brush heap to
sleep on, such a thing as a tent or any form of shelter
being out of the question. He never fully recovered
from a mild form of paralysis induced by these hardships.</p>

<p class='c004'>During one period of his service he was placed as a
guard over a Southern home occupied by its mistress.
The General applied to her for permission to sleep on
the porch of the house, but she promptly responded
that no “Yankee” could sleep on her porch, and he
was compelled to wait until all were asleep before he
could venture to seek its shelter. Being a polite man,
the General did not fail to thank the lady on the following
morning.</p>

<p class='c004'>He used to tell how the Yankees, after stewing
their coffee again and again until there was nothing
left to extract, would sell the grounds to their opponents
for a dollar a pound. Johnny Reb must have
been in straits for coffee.</p>

<p class='c004'>In spite of all he went through the General was a
strong temperance man, never drinking liquor, even
in the army, where good drinking water was often
impossible to find. The General was always to be
found on the side of law and order and was the one
to whom Mr. Hine went in the early days of Woodside
to stop the Sunday horse cars.  Ideas have
<a id='Page_230'></a>changed greatly during the past forty years in regard
to the observance of the Sabbath, and it may seem
strange to some that a serious effort was once made
to disconnect this rural settlement from the rest of
the world on that day, but such is the fact. The
General did get out an injunction and the peace of
the neighborhood was complete for a time, but the
street car people, as usual, had their way in the end.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>MR. JOHN MORRIS PHILLIPS.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Mr. John Morris Phillips belonged to that generation
which was the last to be born in the old farm
house now standing on Summer avenue, and he appears
to have been the first to break away from the
traditions of the farm.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Phillips was born November 4, 1817, and
early showed an inclination for mechanics. He was
apprenticed to the pattern making business under Mr.
Horace T. Poinier, and later found employment under
the noted Seth Boyden; afterward he worked for the
West Point foundry and from there came to the Novelty
Iron Works, New York City, and all this time
was learning and perfecting himself in every detail
for future activity. His memory was so phenomenal
that when he had examined a piece of mechanism its
details never passed from his mind, and he could
duplicate it without again referring to the original.
This, of course, was a tremendous help in after life.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the fall of 1845 the Hewes &amp; Phillips Iron
Works were started in a small way at 60 Vesey
<a id='Page_231'></a>street, New York, but the following year the business
was moved to Newark. The concern grew rapidly to
large proportions, and by the time the Civil War broke
out was one of the foremost establishments of the
kind in the country and during the war it did an immense
amount of work for the government.</p>

<p class='c004'>All the turret machinery for the first “Monitor”—the
one which saved the day in Hampton Roads—was
made here, as was that for the five succeeding monitors
including the Modoc, Cohoes, etc. That the
Monitor’s machinery was well made the action at
Hampton Roads amply proved.</p>

<p class='c004'>Over 200,000 stand of arms were manufactured at
the Hewes &amp; Phillips Works, and here the government
also sent 12,000 flint-lock muskets to be modernized.
These, it is said, were part of a gift to the
country made during the Revolution by LaFayette,
which had not been used at that time.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. James E. Coombes, an expert on American
military small arms, writes that Hewes &amp; Phillips did
alter a number of flint-lock muskets to percussion, but
he doubts if they were such obsolete weapons as those
brought over by LaFayette. Mr. Coombes says: “It
was the policy of the government to use only the later
models of flint-locks for this purpose, as there was a
vast quantity of them on hand. I have seen a number
of these guns. They were stamped ‘H &amp; P’ on
the nipple lug—in fact, have two in my collection,
but they are all late models.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Coombes’s opinion is accepted by military authorities
<a id='Page_232'></a>generally, but in spite of this I am inclined
to think that the story is correct, because it appears
to have come so straight from Mr. John M. Phillips
himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hewes &amp; Phillips also altered 8,000 flint-locks for
the state of New Jersey, asking nothing more in return
from the state than the actual expense of the
work. The machinery for the first Holland submarine
was made here during the Civil War.</p>

<p class='c004'>Owing to threats made by Copperheads during
the latter part of the war that the factory would be
destroyed, the place was guarded day and night by a
company of infantry. At that time Mr. Phillips lived
on Bridge street and his back yard adjoined the machine
works, and he could step from his house to his
shop without exposing himself to possible danger
from the disaffected element.</p>

<p class='c004'>Of the seventy boys and men who went out from
this factory to enlist in the army every one came
back, and not one received a scratch to show for his
service. All apprentices who enlisted before their
time was up were put to work on their return at journeymen’s
wages, while serving the remainder of their
time as apprentices. Thus did the firm at its own expense
recognize the services rendered by these young
men to their country.</p>

<p class='c004'>That Mr. Phillips was a broad-minded and far-seeing
man is not alone proven by the business
foundation he laid, but also by the monument he left
<a id='Page_233'></a>in beautifully embowered Lincoln avenue. His love
for trees was almost as great as for human beings,
and because of this Lincoln avenue is to-day as beautiful
as is the traditional New England village green.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the city saw fit to improve Lincoln avenue
it did so by cutting down all its shade trees and
transforming it into a dreary desolation. Mr. Phillips
had in front of his house a row of cherry trees
which were his pride and admiration and were also,
alas, a source of considerable friction between himself
and the neighborhood small boy, for the boys
found it comparatively easy to adapt themselves to the
Phillips cherries. I believe that their owner finally discovered
that a generous coat of fresh tar on the tree
trunks was as good a small boy preventive as it is in
the case of certain insects. There is a tale of an expressman
who took one of these tarred tree trunks to
his bosom before he discovered the error of his ways,
and the manner in which he blessed his tarry top-lights—so
to speak—is one of the traditions of the
neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c004'>These cherry trees went with the rest, and when
the destruction had been so complete that there was
no further job for the contractor-friend of the politicians
that functionary went elsewhere. Then Mr.
Phillips called on his neighbors in an effort to enlist
them in a plan to rehabilitate their street by the
planting of trees but, finding most of them indifferent,
he planted trees on both sides of the way, from
<a id='Page_234'></a>the cemetery to Phillips Park, a double row one-half
mile long, and it is these trees which to-day shelter
the avenue from the summer’s sun. The trees were
procured from a nursery on his own property located
about where Delavan ends in Summer avenue.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>MR. DAVID MACLURE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>“The memory of him is sweet and pleasant”, more
than one of his former scholars testifies. Mr. Maclure
is a round peg in a round hole, although he happened
into his present line of work in rather an accidental
manner.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was the first clerk that the Prudential Insurance
Company ever employed, but earning his bread
and butter by such uncongenial drudgery soon
wearied him, and he gave up the position with the
idea of turning to art or to the ministry for his life
work; but while in this somewhat uncertain state of
mind the fates decided otherwise.</p>

<p class='c004'>At this time he was living at the home of his parents
on Lincoln avenue, and, when it was learned that
the school at Montgomery was closed for lack of a
teacher, a friend fairly pushed him into the opportunity
thus opened. He shortly became popular with
old and young, and fitted so snugly into the position
that vaulting ambition has never since troubled him.</p>

<p class='c004'>From the Montgomery school he came to the Elliott
Street School in Woodside, was next transferred to
the Eighth Ward School, and from there to the
Chestnut Street School, where he has been principal
<a id='Page_235'></a>for many years. Mr. Maclure has a way of making
study attractive to children and stimulating them to
strive the more to reach that promised land which he
pictures so pleasantly—that those who have once
been his scholars remember the days spent under his
care with unmixed pleasure. “Beyond the Alps lies
Italy”, is the way he sometimes put it to them.</p>

<p class='c004'>The following verse is not offered as an evidence
of Mr. Maclure’s literary skill, but rather to show the
personal interest which he takes in the children, and as
one of the many ways in which he attaches them to
him:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Maclure is a many-sided man: A painter of
pictures—good pictures—a writer of books and magazine
articles, and a designer and maker of fine furniture.
His home is full of his handiwork, which is the
<a id='Page_236'></a>more to be praised because “the kitchen is his work-shop”.</p>

<p class='c004'>A book of poems entitled “Thoughts on Life”, and
two novels, “David Todd” and “Kennedy of Glen
Haugh”, have brought him fame in the literary world,
and he is also the author of several school text-books.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>COL. SAMUEL L. BUCK.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Col. Samuel L. Buck, according to the dry records
of the Adjutant-General’s office at Trenton, was commissioned
Major in the Second Regiment, Infantry,
New Jersey Volunteers, on the twenty-second day of
May, 1861, and was mustered into the United States
service as such for the period of three years. He
was promoted Lieutenant-Colonel January 20, 1862;
Colonel, July 1, 1862; and was honorably discharged
July 21, 1864, during the War of the Rebellion. The
official record goes no further.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was at Chickahominy June 27, 1862, when of
the twenty-eight hundred men in the Second Regiment
only nine hundred and sixty-five answered at
roll-call the following day. He commanded the regiment
at Crampton’s Gap, where it met Longstreet.
He was wounded at Chancellorsville, and was in many
engagements.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Colonel delivered a lecture on his recollections
of army life in the Woodside Presbyterian Church,
April 3, 1879, which was later published in pamphlet
form, but he was so extremely modest as regards his
own part in the fighting that it furnishes no data for
<a id='Page_237'></a>my purpose. Many recall that he had a fine record
for bravery and efficiency, but I have found no one
who could tell the story.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>MR. DANIEL F. TOMPKINS.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Mr. Daniel F. Tompkins was an antiquarian
whose researches brought to light and preserved
much that was interesting concerning the local history
of Woodside. He discovered a number of Revolutionary
relics in the “Anthony Wayne camp
ground” west of Summer avenue in the Carteret
street neighborhood and his inquiries among the old
inhabitants resulted in the preservation of valuable
and interesting matter that would otherwise have
been lost.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Tompkins was a somewhat eccentric man and
had some rather odd fads—possibly the best known of
which was his large flock of goats, which was a
prominent feature of the Washington avenue landscape
for many years. Another, which was possibly
not so well known, was a fondness for choice toilet
soaps, of which he is said to have kept a large quantity
in his house. We all know that cleanliness is
next to Godliness.</p>

<p class='c004'>That he was public spirited and alive to the value
of a park system there is no doubt, in fact he might
almost be called the father of the Essex County park
system of to-day. Mr. Tompkins owned property
around the Boiling Spring, which has been a boundary
mark from time immemorial and one of the corners
<a id='Page_238'></a>of Woodside, and he was the first to suggest a
park in that region, offering to give his land if the
city would purchase more and make the whole into
a public park, and while his offer was not taken, there
is little doubt but that he helped to start the agitation
which resulted in the present system of breathing
places for the people.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>JOHN F. DRYDEN.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The history of the man who has made a success of
this life is always interesting. Starting with nothing
but a willingness to work and an ability to think and
having faith enough in himself and his ideas to hold to
his purpose through all set-backs and discouragements,
he is reasonably sure to reach the top.</p>

<p class='c004'>When or where Mr. Dryden was born I do not
know, but he may have come from the land of wooden
nutmegs, as he was a graduate of Yale. I do know
that he came to Woodside in the early seventies a poor
man; so poor, if his old neighbors remember rightly,
that he did not even possess an overcoat to keep out
the chill of winter.</p>

<p class='c004'>One cold, cheerless day a gentleman and lady with
two children were seen to enter a vacant house on
Lincoln avenue, just below Elwood. Those living
nearby noted that the gentleman made frequent excursions
to the front gate, evidently looking for that
load of furniture which did not come. After considerable
persuasion he was induced to accept an invitation
from a neighbor to spend the waiting time in that
neighbor’s house.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_239'></a>Such was Mr. Dryden’s introduction to Woodside,
but even then he was dreaming of industrial insurance,
and his constant companions and most intimate
friends were mortality tables and dry statistics, and it
was not long before he became acquainted with certain
gentlemen who succumbed to his persuasive
tongue and furnished the capital with which the Prudential
was started.</p>

<p class='c004'>At first the company consisted of Mr. Dryden and
an office boy, and occupied a corner of somebody’s
store on Broad street, Mr. Dryden’s salary at this time
being $10 per week but growth was rapid, and soon
Col. Samuel L. Buck was installed as assistant, and it
was not long before the office became a hive of Woodside
men and boys, many of whom have grown up
with it and still remain in its employ.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is not necessary to follow Mr. Dryden through
his many successes. He long ago became too great
for Woodside, and removed to other surroundings,
but he is part of the early history of this region.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“One with a flash begins and ends in smoke;</div>
      <div class='line'>The other out of smoke brings glorious light,</div>
      <div class='line'>And (without raising expectation high)</div>
      <div class='line'>Surprises us with dazzling miracles.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h4 class='c008'>THE “COUNT”.</h4>
<p class='c006'>No stronger contrast to Mr. Dryden could be
shown than in the person of “Count” Whitehead, a
debonair gentleman who began with a flash and ended
in smoke. For a brief period our friend was the glass
of fashion and the mould of form for Woodside; he
<a id='Page_240'></a>had some money and an ability to “blow it in” that
was notable. During this period he drove tandem and
clothed his Adonis-like figure in a way that held all
eyes. When last heard of the “Count” was a ticket
chopper in the Pennsylvania ferry house.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>LIEUT.-COL. W. E. BLEWETT.</h4>
<p class='c006'>In the spring of 1861, Mr. Blewett became active
in organizing a company of volunteers, the men being
recruited principally from Belleville. This company
of 101 men subsequently formed Company F of the
Second Regiment of New Jersey (three-year volunteers).
They were mustered in at Trenton May 1st,
1861, as part of the First New Jersey Brigade, reporting
on May 6th at Washington, being the first fully
organized brigade to arrive for the defense of the National
Capital. A few days later the brigade crossed
the Potomac, and was the first regiment of three-year
volunteers to enter the state of Virginia.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the Battle of Bull Run, July 21st, 1861, the
Brigade (4th Division under General Runyon) was
held as a reserve, but not engaged. They, however,
were of service in covering the retreat of our army to
Centerville. Later the Second was attached to the
First Brigade (Kearny’s), Franklin Division; afterward
to the First Brigade, First Division, First Army
Corps. After much service and a most brilliant career,
on the expiration of its term, the Brigade returned to
New Jersey for muster out.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Second New Jersey was pre-eminently a fighting
regiment.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_241'></a>On June 12th, 1861, Mr. Blewett was mustered in
as Second Lieutenant of Company F; June 4th, 1862,
received commission as First Lieutenant, and April
16th, 1862, by command of Brigadier General Kearny,
was detailed to take command of the Provost and Artillery
Guards. Of this command he was very proud,
owing to the fact that the appointment came direct
from General Kearny, a much coveted honor.</p>

<p class='c004'>Friday, June 27th, 1862, the First New Jersey
Brigade was ordered to Woodbury’s Bridge over the
Chickahominy, there to meet Gen. Porter’s Division.
(Six companies of the Second, under Lieut.-Col. Samuel
L. Buck, were at that time on picket duty, and
therefore took no part in this action.) Colonel Tucker
led out the remaining four companies, including Lieutenant
Blewett’s command with the rest of the Brigade.
From Woodbury’s Bridge this Brigade, with
others, was sent to engage the enemy near Gaines’s
Mills and was soon in the thick of the fight.
Porter’s Division, in hand-to-hand conflict, held
their position against overwhelming odds until
reinforcements, long delayed, arrived, but owing
to the fact that their position was unfavorable
and to the superiority of the enemy in numbers,
the Union troops were compelled to retire.
(The Confederate forces numbered perhaps 56,000;
the Union troops, 33,000. The Union loss was 6,000
killed and wounded, besides nearly 2,000 prisoners.
The Confederate loss was placed at 9,000 killed and
<a id='Page_242'></a>wounded.) The Second Regiment had the right of
line, and though outnumbered and flanked by the
enemy, they were the last to leave their station in the
field. In this fight the regiment lost its colonel, Isaac
M. Tucker, Capt. Charles Danforth, Color Sergeant
Thomas Stevens of Belleville, and many others. The
flags taken at this time were returned by a North
Carolina regiment many years after. On the afternoon
of June 27th Lieutenant Blewett was shot in the
right breast. The ball took a downward course, and
remained lodged in his side. While working his way to
the hospital a fragment of a bursting shell cut his belt
and accoutrements from his side. Upon arriving at
Gaines’s Mills, then used as a hospital, Dr. Oakley
dressed his wound and advised him to stop there, but
fearing capture he continued on. This was fortunate,
as later all the wounded at that hospital were taken
prisoners. Aided by his colored servant he reached
home in Belleville, July 4th, 1862. Owing to the fact
that the ball could not be located the wound was long
in healing. This incapacitated him for active service,
and while stationed in Washington, September 9th,
1862, he resigned. Later Lieutenant Blewett became
active in the National Guard of this state, was commissioned
Captain Company H, Second Regiment,
New Jersey Rifle Corps, September 19th, 1866; Captain
Company H, Second Regiment National Guard,
April 14th, ’69; Major and Quartermaster on the staff
of Joseph W. Plume, Brigadier-General First Brigade,
October 27th, ’69; Lieutenant-Colonel and Brigade Inspector,
<a id='Page_243'></a>November 27th, ’71; resigned November 30th,
’74.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>MR. THOMAS W. KINSEY.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Mr. Thomas W. Kinsey comes from a long line of
warriors, and has lived up to the traditions of the
family.</p>

<p class='c004'>Four brothers of the name came to this country
in the Mayflower: two settled in Connecticut and two
in New Jersey. An early ancestor, John Kinsey, was
speaker of the New Jersey House of Representatives.
The grandfather of Thomas W., Joel Kinsey, fought
in the Revolution; his son, Joel, Jr., volunteered for
the war of 1812, and his grandson, Thomas W., above,
when fifteen years of age, enlisted for three years at
the beginning of the Civil War and, when his time
had expired, re-enlisted on the field for three more,
or until the end of the war, putting in four years and
seven months of fighting.</p>

<p class='c004'>During this time he received four wounds and two
furloughs, one of ten days for bravery on the field of
battle and one of thirty days after serving three years
in the ranks. And Mr. Kinsey says he “had no special
adventures—just plenty of fighting”.</p>

<p class='c004'>By the time his mother had given her consent to
his enlistment all the New Jersey regiments were full,
so this fifteen-year-old boy went to New York and
enlisted at Fort Schuyler in the First Long Island
Regiment, which was principally raised through the
efforts of Henry Ward Beecher, whose brother was
chaplain to the regiment and whose son was a lieutenant
<a id='Page_244'></a>therein. This regiment was later known as
the 67th N. Y., and when its members became decimated
by slaughter it was merged in the 65th N. Y.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Kinsey was in all the principal engagements
of the Army of the Potomac except that at Winchester.
During the Battle of the Wilderness he received
a bullet in his leg which he carries yet. At the
Seven Days’ Battle, under Brigadier General Abercrombie,
his regiment could see nothing in front because
of fields of tall grain, and he alone volunteered
to scout, keeping a couple of hundred yards more or
less in advance of the line, climbing trees and exposing
himself in other ways, and it was for this exhibition
of bravery that he received the ten days’ furlough
referred to above.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was promoted to the sergeancy of Company C,
67th N. Y.; was shot in the head while before Petersburg,
a “minie” ball, which is about the size of one’s
thumb, passing through his cheek and out of the back
of his head at the base of the brain. Because of this
wound he was in the Fairfax Seminary, which had
been turned into a hospital, when Lincoln was shot,
but through the efforts of Governor Ward was transferred
to Newark, and was here in the hospital some
three months, being mustered out while still a patient,
on August 8, 1865.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Kinsey came to Woodside in 1867 and has ever
since resided at the northeast corner of Summer place
and May street, in the first house erected by Morrison
&amp; Briggs.</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_245'></a>
  <h4 class='c008'>DR. J. E. JANES.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Dr. J. E. Janes is worth a good word if for no
other reason than because of the good he did.
The Doctor never refused to go when a call
came, no matter what the night, or if he
knew that there was no money compensation
for him. He was endowed with that good
Samaritan disposition that is so typical of our associations
with all that is best in the old-fashioned
country doctor—everybody’s friend and at the service
of all. When the Doctor found it necessary to remove
his family to the balm of the southern California
coast Woodside lost a man.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>MR. PETER WEILER.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Mr. Peter Weiler of the River road is spoken of
as a man of large stature and determination and,
withal, not easily bluffed. When the Paterson &amp;
Newark Railroad (now the Newark Branch of the
Erie) was put through, the railroad people made
every effort to avoid adequate payment for the land
taken, and in many cases they succeeded in securing
the property for little or nothing, but such an arrangement
did not at all meet with the views of Mr.
Weiler, and when they attempted to rush his place
he built a rail fence across the proposed line of track
and mounted guard with a shotgun, and the railroaders,
like Davy Crocket’s coon, came down.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>BELLARS.</h4>
<p class='c006'>One of the queer sticks of the times was Bellars,
the church organist. No one ever called him “Mr.”
<a id='Page_246'></a>Bellars—he was just plain Bellars—an odd combination
of ignorance and musical genius. He could not
read the simplest Sunday school music but, once he
heard a tune, nothing could drive it out of his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>When it came to new music he was a trying
proposition and grievously tormented Mr. Hine’s
patience. Occasionally there were stormy scenes
about the organ loft, and at least once Mr. Hine
threatened to dismiss him if there was not an immediate
improvement, winding up his peroration with
“It’s a short horse and it’s soon curried”.</p>

<p class='c004'>During the latter years of the Bellars reign Mr.
Hine owned a house on Cottage street, opposite the
school house, which he allowed the former to occupy
rent free as compensation for his weekly performance
on the organ, and somehow the organist got it into
his twisted noddle that the house had been given to
him for work done, and it became necessary for the
court to pass on the matter.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bellars employed Will Cumming as his attorney,
and the latter showed considerable genius in handling
the case, for he led his forlorn hope in such fashion
that he almost prevailed against the facts, and as Mr.
Hine’s lawyer was as lame as Will was active, the
case actually looked serious at one time because of
the ease with which the young man whipped the elder
around the legal stump.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bellars was the music teacher of the neighborhood
at a time when my benighted parents conceived the
<a id='Page_247'></a>notion that I should learn to play the piano. Now,
while Mr. Hine was very musical, my mother’s one
standard of music was the speed at which it was performed,
and one could play to her on a Sunday such
a secular composition as “Yankee Doodle”, if only it
were played slow and solemnly, and she would accept
it as orthodox without hesitation, and I am my
mother’s son when it comes to musical matters; hence
I call my parents benighted for casting their money
before Bellars.</p>

<p class='c004'>So far as can be judged, at this distance, Bellars’s
chief notion of the teacher’s function was to receive
the dollar, or whatever the lesson cost. Thus we can
readily comprehend what the result must have been
when such a teacher and such a pupil got together.
The gentleman was a ventriloquist, or said he was,
and he would cause little birds to sing up the chimney
or under the piano, and sometimes a cat would meow
or a dog bark in the far corner of the room. All this
served to pass the hour devoted to the weekly lesson.</p>

<p class='c004'>The last time I saw Bellars was some years after
his departure from Woodside, on an occasion when
he was gawking down Broadway with a carpet bag
that must have long lain dormant in some neglected
corner, a picture that would have done a Puck artist
a world of good, with his lean figure and excruciatingly
thin visage. What was his latter end I know
not, but I verily believe that he dried up and blew
away.</p>

  <a id='Page_248'></a>
  <h4 class='c008'>BOATING DAYS ON THE PASSAIC.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>During the eighties and early nineties the Passaic
river, where it skirted Woodside, was one of the most
celebrated rowing courses in the country, and here
assembled well-known oarsmen from far and near, including
such men as Courtney, Hanlon, Oomes, Ten
Eyck, Edward Phillips and George Lee.</p>

<p class='c004'>So far as known, the Rev. Mr. Sherman, rector of
Christ Church, Belleville, was the first to use a
racing shell on the river. Closely following Mr. Sherman
came Mr. James S. Taylor, whose earliest recollections
are of the river and its ways. Mr. Taylor
grew up on the water and was one of its first boatmen.</p>

<p class='c004'>Probably the first boat club was the Woodside
Rowing Club; but this was more of a social organization
with rowing as a side issue. John Eastwood,
a leading member, later joined the Tritons and became
Commodore of the Passaic River Rowing Association.
The Passaic Boat Club is considered the first.
Its original house was situated about opposite Centre
street, but it was not long before the Club moved to
Woodside and established itself just below the Point
House.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Triton Boat Club, the third to be organized,
soon out-distanced the others, and became the
social as well as the boating centre of the Passaic.
It was really born in 1868, in Phil. Bower’s boathouse,
where certain oarsmen stored their boats, but was not
officially organized until 1873, when the members met
in the office of the Newark Lime &amp; Cement Company.
<a id='Page_249'></a>Twelve men attended this meeting, but only six names
are given as organizers of the club: Frederick Townley,
Henry C. Rommel, Truman Miller, Samuel A.
Smith, Frederick Earl and Sidney Ogden. The other
six seceded and organized the Eureka Boat Club.</p>

<p class='c004'>About 1875 the club built its first house at the foot
of the Gully road, and the following year the first regatta
was held. The Passaic offered a beautiful course
to oarsmen, but it did not come prominently before
the country until the Eurekas rowed in the races held
at Philadelphia during the Centennial. This called
attention to the Passaic and resulted in the first National
Regatta on its waters, 1878. A moonlight race
between the Tritons and the Viking Boat Club of
Elizabeth, which was pulled off in October, 1879, is
remembered as one of the notable events.</p>

<p class='c004'>Both Edward and Frank Phillips were prominent
as oarsmen of the club, the former so much so that he,
with Henry Rommel, was sent to the National Regatta
held at Saratoga in 1881 or 1882. Henry Rommel,
by the way, is probably the most “be-medaled”
member of the club. George Small was another well-known
Triton, as was George Lee who was brought
out by the club and sent by it to England.</p>

<p class='c004'>Those enthusiastic members who had no time for
meals, recall Ed. Holt’s “Floating Palace” with its
cargo of pie and soft drinks as a welcome haven of
refuge, and they also indorse the statement that the
place was entirely respectable.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>A Canoe Regatta On The Passaic. As seen from the float of the Ianthe Canoe Club.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>It is still a matter of common remark by oarsmen
of other localities that the Passaic was the finest river
on which they ever rowed.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Triton organization still exists in the hope
that some day the river will be restored to its old-time
purity and again be in condition for aquatic sports,
but all it does at present is to eat a dinner once each
year. It is rather a remarkable fact that the club has
never lost an active member by death, except in one
case of suicide.</p>

<p class='c004'>Possibly the first racing boat other than a single
shell owned by the Triton Club, was one fitted for
three pairs of oars and a coxswain, which was originally
purchased by a well-known group of gentlemen
that resided on the banks of the Passaic. John Rutherfurd
was one of these, and the boat was kept for a
long time on the lawn in front of his dwelling.</p>

<p class='c004'>One of the familiar figures of early days was Doctor
Lauterborn, of Mulberry street who, after walking
to the Passaic boathouse, thought nothing of rowing
to the city of Passaic and back, finishing his afternoon
by walking home.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>CANOEING RECOLLECTIONS.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The history of the Ianthe Canoe Club, and of
canoeing in general on the Passaic river, dates back to
a certain mysterious green canvas canoe that, in 1880,
appeared from no one knows where. Presumably it
was constructed by some budding genius in the loft of
his father’s barn, but all that we know definitely now
is that its discovery was made by Will McDonald.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_251'></a>This green canoe was the inspiration which set
others at work and during the winter of ’80-1 a second
canvas canoe, painted black, was built in the cellar of
77 Lincoln avenue, by “Lin” Palmer, who, as he won
the first canoe race ever paddled on the Passaic and
launched the first white man’s canoe on our beautiful
stream, so far as is known, is entitled to a central position
in the limelight.</p>

<p class='c004'>The black Palmer was launched with much circumstance
in the following spring, and was at that
time the only canoe on the river, as its green progenitor
was not baptized until some time later, when
Will McDonald purchased her.</p>

<p class='c004'>In 1881 a group of six boys, consisting of Lincoln
B. Palmer, Robert M. and Albert Phillips, Will McDonald,
John Russell and one other, formed the
Ianthe Canoe Club. John Russell was boy in a drug
store at the corner of Belleville and Bloomfield avenues,
and he brought to the meeting a soda water
fountain catalogue, which contained many pretty
names, and from this the name of the club was selected,
the lady appearing therein as a particularly attractive
water sprite. George P. Douglass, who became
a factor in canoeing circles about 1887, was a
later acquisition to the club.</p>

<p class='c004'>The old Woodside Rowing Club’s building was
standing idle. It belonged to the Messers. Hendricks,
and a visit to these gentlemen resulted in an arrangement
whereby the club was to have the building rent
free, provided it kept the place in repair.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_252'></a>The club grew and prospered and in August, 1882,
its members were invited by the Triton Boat Club to
participate in the first canoe race ever held on the
river. It seems that one Hussey, a member of the
Triton Club owned a canoe and had a reputation as a
paddler, and it was because there was no one else to
play with that the boys were asked to enter the race.
There was no thought but that Hussey would win;
he had been in races before and was the star of the
occasion. “Lin” Palmer beat him quite handily and
there was gloom in the home of the Tritons. And thus
ended the first canoe race, which was participated in
by “Walt” and Will McDougall, as well as by “Lin”
Palmer and —— Hussey.</p>

<p class='c004'>During the following five years the club prospered
greatly, but no events of importance are recorded. In
1887 John Pierson, of Bloomfield, and “Lin” Palmer,
were sent as the first representatives from the Passaic
river to an American Canoe Association meet, which
this year was held on Lake Champlain. Neither of
these representatives had ever been on such an expedition
before, and their outfit was primitive in the
extreme—so much so that they were shortly dubbed
“the frying pan cruisers” by those who traveled with
more elaborate and cumbersome outfits. But from
now on the Ianthe moved up into the front rank of
canoeists, as its members acquired the habit of capturing
prizes, and held this position until the condition
of the river drove all boating from its surface.</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_253'></a>
  <h4 class='c008'>A LAST WORD IN REGARD TO MR. HINE.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>We have about come to the end of this somewhat
peculiar narrative, but before closing it I wish to say
a final word in regard to Mr. Hine: I have interviewed
very many who had to do with the early days
of Woodside, without reference as to whether they
were personal friends or not, and have heard but one
opinion expressed, and universally expressed, in a manner
too sincere to admit of any doubt. Each one recalls
the man with a vividness and interest that time
seemingly cannot dull, and each impression is but a
repetition in one form or another of a great heart and
a pure, clean minded man.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is given to few to be remembered as is Mr.
Hine, and though he has been dead more than twelve
years (April 16, 1897), the memory of him and the
impression he left are as distinct and clear as though
his departure were but yesterday. The abundant
tears which were shed over his bier came from hundreds
who felt that they had lost a personal friend
and helper.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_254'></a>
  <h2 class='c005'>PART III.</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <a id='Page_255'></a>
  <h3 class='c007'>C. C. HINE—PERSONAL.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The following is personal to C. C. Hine, the writer’s
father, and consists of extracts from a “private”
book, from obituary notices, anecdotes, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'>I have found it impossible to select words that give
a true idea of my father’s character, it was so simple,
so lovable, so pure, and yet so strong, and even
rugged. He had a faith that nothing could shake.
There was no room for doubt in his mind; his religion
was to him an absolute fact, and when his wonderful
strength of character and broad knowledge of the
world are considered, this child-like trust was remarkable.
As boy and man he received many hard knocks
in the struggle for existence and had seen rough and
trying times, but through it all he kept his mind clean
and his love for his fellow-man bright.</p>

<p class='c004'>Presumably he was always so—the testimony of
his mother indicated it, and I have only recently discovered
a private book which was never intended for
other eyes, but which shows one of his phases so
clearly that it is here quoted from at length.</p>

<p class='c004'>November 20, 1852, Mr. Hine wrote in this book
which he then started for the purpose of systematizing
and keeping track of his giving: “Three
<a id='Page_256'></a>weeks before the beginning of the present month, I
came to a definite conclusion regarding a system of
formal and regular giving for charitable and religious
purposes, with which to govern my future course.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He adopted a scale system whereby, if his income
ever reached $14,000 he would give one-half of it
away, and this was not intended to cover “occasional
and irregular giving”.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the time he made this covenant with himself
he was receiving, in St. Louis, $800 per annum. On
the 1st of November he removed to New Albany, Ind.,
and began again at $400 per annum, but on December
1st his income was increased to the rate of $600
per annum.</p>

<p class='c004'>That he gave until it hurt him there is ample evidence,
for we read in January, 1853: “I find myself
very much straitened in many matters and greatly
fear I will fall far behind my hopes of what I should
save up for my visit home March 1st”; but his accounts
show that he kept on giving.</p>

<p class='c004'>“July 4, 1853, I was married.—Prov. xxxi.:11.
Amen. During August I was preparing to engage in
a new line of duty, and as I am now entering upon an
employment whose results will not be ascertainable
each month I must credit what I give as I go along
and then balance up a year hence.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Apparently on December 31, 1854, he writes: “Not
knowing the precise condition of my business I have
been unable to charge up the percentages heretofore.
I now find that my net income for the year ending, say,
<a id='Page_257'></a>August, 1854, was about $1,800, besides my living.
This, situated as I was, did not amount to more than
$200 for self and wife. Calling the year in round
numbers $2,000 I must charge myself with one fifteenth
of the whole amount, which is $133.33....
I thought I was wonderfully liberal all along through
these sixteen months, and yet the figures bring me in
debt $75! I can never be sufficiently thankful that
God put it into my heart to begin this account, for I
have found that the majority of my opportunities for
giving have occurred when, from exterior circumstances,
I have ‘felt poor’, and but for the consciousness
that I owed, fairly, justly and honestly owed,
according to a bargain of my own making, a large balance
to the Lord’s work in general, and perchance—who
could know—to the very case in hand in particular,
I should not have given even the little I have.”</p>

<p class='c004'>By December 31, 1856, he had exceeded the limit
for giving established by his scale to the extent of
over 32 per cent. He debates with himself as to
whether he should charge his pew rent in this account,
but finally concludes to do so.</p>

<p class='c004'>In 1857 he notes that his income is about $2,000
“and my family has been increased by a Father,
Mother and Sister-in-Law, making me six mouths to
fill instead of three....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I must now record one of those eras that will
happen in men’s lives when they are not content to let
well enough alone:—</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_258'></a>“In April, 1857, I abandoned a prosperous business,
mounted a hobby and galloped headlong into an enterprise
that has sunk every cent I had in the world
and plunged me very deeply in debt besides, so that I
will have to work for years to extricate myself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have now—July, 1858—as the result of my
folly, no offering of money to make to the Lord’s
cause.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then follows his account brought forward which,
in spite of the fact that only one dollar is credited “By
Missionary Subscription”, is still somewhat ahead of
his limit.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Many months have gone by since the foregoing
was written—months of varied experience.</p>

<p class='c004'>“In January, 1859, I relinquished my school enterprise,
a loser, probably, of $13,000 and about $7,000
‘worse than nothing’.... Providentially I was
not permitted to remain idle a day. January 1st I was
engaged with the Ætna Insurance Company at $1,500
per annum....</p>

<p class='c004'>“It has been a matter of much debate in my mind
whether it was proper for me while so deeply involved
in debt to ‘give away’ anything. It has seemed like
assuming to disburse the money that belongs to others
without their knowledge or consent.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I do not find, however, that, when I entered into
this covenant seven years ago, I made any provision
for my present predicament. Hence I must regard
this covenant as prior, and not to be annulled by subsequent
transactions. I am glad that I can see this
<a id='Page_259'></a>view of the case very plainly, as I find great comfort
in it. I shall now be relieved from one of the most
onerous results of my pecuniary disaster—inability to
join in the various contributions to the Lord’s cause.</p>

<p class='c004'>“During the Winter and Spring of 1859 I was
traveling in Texas. The following Summer in Kentucky,
and the Winter of 1860 in Georgia, Alabama
and other Southern States, until April. All this time
being under great pecuniary pressure and not having
clearly arrived at the decision just above recorded,
my contributions were neither frequent nor large. No
regular account was kept and I can only recall two in
addition to those recorded.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then follows his ledger account with the various
percentages charged against him, and showing that he
had fallen considerably behind his scale.</p>

<p class='c004'>“In June, 1860, I removed my family to Covington,
Ky., to be near my business headquarters in Cincinnati,
and I trust that I may again fall into somewhat
like regularity of habits, both in my business life and
Christian experience....”</p>

<p class='c004'>April 5, 1861: “Hitherto this record has been kept
in an old ‘Pass Book’, but from its semi-journal form
it has assumed dimensions not anticipated nine years
ago, when first begun. Hence I have purchased this
book and copied out and set in order the whole thing
from the beginning.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I find that this long parade of figures and
remarks is likely—unless I have a care—to prove a
<a id='Page_260'></a>snare to me, as Gideon’s ephod did to him and his
house. Truly man delighteth in vanity.”</p>

<p class='c004'>During the three years past his income had been
gradually increased to $2,000 per annum, but “Sept.
1 (1862) my income was again decreased, on account
of the stringency of war times, to $1,500”....</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is the second year of the great civil war;
times have been pretty hard for men with fixed incomes,
but I have kept even, thanks to a kind Providence.”</p>

<p class='c004'>By July, 1864, he had nearly caught up in his giving
to the amount with which he had debited himself.
At this time he writes:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let me here record one of those singular and
precious providences that my faith, thank God, is
broad enough to recognize. The ‘war times’ were
pinching me, prices of necessaries were enormous.
Only by the closest figuring could I ‘make both ends
meet’. I said to the Lord ‘Send me an increase and I
will make a thank offering of the first $100’. On a
business visit to New York this month I unexpectedly
got a contract to write a book for $500, a matter to be
completed ‘nights and mornings’ in three or four
months. On my return home I obtained an advance
on my salary of $750 per annum. An opportunity suddenly
presented itself also for me to buy a piece of
paper at a profit of $98 which I cleared in a transaction
involving a couple of hours’ labor. These three
things (if I except the advanced salary, which I ought
<a id='Page_261'></a>to have had long ago, but had almost despaired of)
were unexpected and providential. I was thus
granted the honor of assisting in the rescue of the
American Board by a greatly advanced (for me) contribution.”</p>

<p class='c004'>January 9, 1865: “I was elected secretary of the International
Insurance Company of New York, at a
salary of $6,000. If I make a thank offering of my
first half-month’s salary it will be in harmony with the
past, but a small testimonial for the Lord’s goodness
to me in giving me more than I asked.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He then debits himself “To Thank Offering $250”.</p>

<p class='c004'>“In March (1865) I removed from Walnut Hills,
Ohio, to New York with my family, and on May 1st
to Brooklyn, L. I., where we connect ourselves with
the South Congregational Church, Rev. Edward Taylor,
Pastor.”</p>

<p class='c004'>By June, 1865, he had again slightly exceeded his
limit of giving, and thereafter seems to have kept well
ahead.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We resided but one year in Brooklyn and in May,
1866, we went to Piermont, N. Y., on the Hudson, to
spend the Summer. Here we remained four months
and in September went to Newark, N. J., where we
boarded until March, 1867, when, on the completion
of our new house at Woodside, N. J., we removed to
that beautiful place in the expectation and hope of
making it our permanent home. Our family consisted
of six souls.”</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_262'></a>The next entry was made in 1879, and reads:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“Years have elapsed—twelve of them—since the
last entry in this book, and I have been meantime
having my books of account kept as memoranda,
rather than as double entry accounts, in deference to
a favorite employee, so that I have been unable to
make precise statements. For 1867 I paid income tax
on $6,280, but that was after allowed deductions of
nearly $1,900. In March, 1868, I became the proprietor
of the Insurance Monitor in New York and entered
upon a publishing business which for several
years netted me $12,000 per annum. Since 1873 this
has gradually fallen off and now, 1879, amounts to
but half as much. I think that, for the last thirteen
years, 1867-1879 inclusive, $8,000 per annum would
be a full statement of my profits....”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Hine goes on to state that during all these
years he has kept no detailed account, but is satisfied
he has given sufficient to cover the percentage due,
and that “there is no necessity for detailed entries and,
besides, I am reminded of a passage in the life of
Ichabod Washburn, where he found that such an account
as this let his right hand know what his left was
doing, and he abandoned it. So long, therefore, as I
am quite clear that I am disbursing as much or more
than my contract calls for, I will omit the entries
here”.</p>

<p class='c004'>Under date 1886 he writes: “It is six years since
I have looked or written in this book and it will probably
<a id='Page_263'></a>be longer before I open it again. Meantime I am
glad that I released myself from bookkeeping in the
matter of giving. Without accounts quite as well as
with them I am conscious that I have lived up to my
plan and I expect to do so in the future.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The last entry is dated 1892: “Wholly by accident
I came upon this book. I am past sixty-six years old
now. I have nothing to add except that for the last
few years, perhaps five or six, I have not been giving
as freely as I formerly did. This is partly because of
a change in my convictions of duty in regard to my
local church relations, and partly because the general
demands upon me have crowded my income very
closely, and partly because my business has been less
remunerative and my accounts unsystematically kept.
I do not remember the details very fully, but my general
consciousness is that I am falling behind in my
giving and getting in debt on this account.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When Mr. Hine summed up as above he evidently
did not include his “occasional and irregular giving”
for an examination of his check stubs after his death
led to the belief that he was then giving away fully
50 per cent of his income.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>WHAT OTHERS THOUGHT OF MR. HINE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>It is difficult to put on paper that which will adequately
depict Mr. Hine’s many-sided character, but
the following extracts from some of the death notices
written by those who knew him best in his business
life are given to show what sort of an impression he
made on these:—</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_264'></a>“He was always so active that, although he had
passed his seventy-first birthday, his death was
something that had never been thought of by anybody
except possibly himself. He traveled so much, did so
much, was interested in so many things, that he will
be widely missed. His was a many sided nature. He
had a good knowledge of both art and mechanics....

noble character, in which there mingled all the elements
that do honor to man.... The professional
labors of Mr. Hine may pass on to other hands, but
the personality of the man has left an impress which
will make his name honored and revered long after
the busy world has ceased to think of his professional
work.... As an editor he was in his vocation,
for his very wide reading, shrewd judgment, great capacity
for literary work, raised him to great distinction

He was an able man, a good man, steadfast
in friendship, large in the spirit of comradeship, gentle,
kind and true.... Constant growth and intellectual

characteristics.... He was a many-sided man—interested
and studious in various directions...
His popularity in the insurance business and far beyond
it, was not the result of a promiscuous outpouring
of honeyed words, for he was a man of decided
opinions, and could always give good reasons for the
faith that was in him.... Mr. Hine was a remarkable

<p class='c004'>“The passing away of Charles C. Hine, the widely
respected editor and publisher of the Insurance Monitor,
of New York, has brought sadness and a sense of
personal loss to thousands of hearts. He was an upright
man, a forceful character in the world, and in
many respects lived an ideal life. His career was one
of usefulness, and the world is better off because he
lived. It was his good fortune to be favored in liberal
measure with those endowments which won and retained
the cordial regard of the multitudes who knew
<a id='Page_271'></a>him. A man of inflexible integrity of character, of
superior mental equipment, and a disposition which
constantly inspired him to modest acts of helpfulness
and sunshine, he was more than respected—he was beloved.
As journalist, publisher, author and public
speaker, he stood in the foremost rank in the insurance
circles of the United States, and he constantly dignified
and took pride in his work.”—[United States Review, April 22d.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The personality of him who was affectionately
known as the ‘Patriarch’ covered more than literary
talent, more than business ability, more than professional
strength. It embraced, as many of us can testify,
an instinctive and undeviating support of the
highest ideals of integrity, honesty and honor....
His heart was kindly, and his life pure and upright.
As a friend and neighbor he was sympathetic and
helpful; as a counsellor of those in need his aid was
unstinted.”—[Resolutions adopted by the Fire Underwriters’
Association of the Pacific.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘A good name is better than riches’, says the
proverbialist of the Old Scripture, and the truth of the
saying is never more forcibly illustrated than when
death has called away the possessor of such a name.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing is said of the amount of money accumulated
by Mr. Hine during his lifetime, but all are eloquent
in praise of his integrity, his courage in well-doing,
his broad charity and his devotion to the cause
of righteousness and truth.... Colonel Hine
<a id='Page_272'></a>was a rare man, one whose example shines like a beacon
above the rocks and shoals of commercial life, reminding
those still voyaging there that deeds ‘are the
harvest of eternity’.”—[Vindicator.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We know that he does not participate in our proceedings
to-day, but who dares to say that, from beyond
the purple and the gold, his keen eye is not
watching us, and that his old-time smile does not beam
from his pale, thoughtful, scholarly, beautiful face, as
we have so often seen it do at these meetings. Such a
man as he was, with the work he did, and the example
he gave, needs no eulogy. Let us then try to
tell, in plain and simple language, the story of his
life, which was like a beautiful road, strewn on either
side with flowers and fruits, with birds and butterflies....</p>

<p class='c004'>“Charles C. Hine was more than we have hastily
described him as being. He was something besides a
telegraph operator, an underwriter, an editor, a business
man, a lecturer. He was a great man with a
great soul; a good man with a good heart; a strong
man with a strong mind. He was a man who had
traveled as far as the sun and yet never gotten away
from his childhood. He was the Doctor Johnson in
whatever circle he chose to move, and yet as modest
as a girl. He was the pride and glory of a great profession
and yet as unassuming as a bashful boy. He
remembered the love of his father, the caresses of his
mother and the kisses of his sister—contact with the
<a id='Page_273'></a>world did not harden his heart. He married the
woman he loved, and for over forty years lived a perfect
wedded life. He was a consistent member of the
church and for thirty years the superintendent of a
Sunday School. He was a working officer of the International
Law &amp; Order League. Three or four
years ago, at Chautauqua, he addressed an audience
of over five thousand persons. To measure the good
he did in the world would be as impossible as to estimate
the blessing of the sun’s rays. He became an
old man on earth and continued to believe in God, in
charity, in love, in goodness. He found inspiration in
the stars, music in the birds, wisdom in babes, and
peace in the Bible. He believed in women and trusted
men.—[Memorial address of I. W. Holman.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A few days later, in the little church, the simple
ceremony was performed. The house was filled to
overflowing by men, women and children, neighbors
and friends—all mourners. With streaming eyes they
followed him to his last resting place on earth. His
grave was filled with flowers and tears, and dedicated,
in sorrow, to love. The dusk gathered softly, the
shadows fell slowly—a helper of the poor, of the
widow and the fatherless, was gone....</p>

<p class='c004'>“If it is the noblest epitaph to be written over the
grave, that the man who lies there has been active,
determined and firm in his principles, and has won
notable success while passing through the fire of life
<a id='Page_274'></a>without a stain of dishonesty upon his character, then
Charles C. Hine lies fairly crowned with that finest
laurel of mortality.”—[From memorial adopted by the National Association
of Life Underwriters.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The death of Mr. C. C. Hine removes one of the
most conspicuous figures in insurance journalism.
Personally, we lose a valued friend, the profession
loses an ornament. He was a good editor, a vigorous
writer, a clear thinker, and a student. He led a cleanly
life. His methods were pure and honorable, and he
was a man that every editor of a paper could point to
with pride, and say: ‘He is the Patriarch’ of us. His
death came as a great surprise. We had always considered
him physically strong and likely to live for
many years. But then we did not think of the fact
that he had lived the prescribed limit of ‘three score
years and ten’. It appears that he had been ailing for
a long time, and on Saturday, the 16th, he sank quietly
to rest. The Insurance Monitor, whose columns he
so long presided over, will miss him greatly, and his
death will prove a distinct loss, not only to journalism,
but to the entire profession of underwriting.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Monday afternoon, a meeting of the insurance
journalists was held in the office of The Weekly Underwriter,
and the following minute was adopted:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘The insurance journalists of New York, convened
this 20th day of April, 1897, upon news of the
death of Mr. Charles C. Hine, unite in testifying their
<a id='Page_275'></a>sorrow for their own great loss and in respectfully
tendering their sympathy to the bereaved family.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘As editor and publisher for nearly fifty years of
the Insurance Monitor, he had in all sincerity and with
eminent ability wrought well for what he deemed the
best in insurance—the best for all. Nor in this way
alone, but in very many public addresses, in books and
pamphlets of his own, and in contributions to other
books, had he labored to the same good purpose. And
so he came to be, in fact, as long ago he was affectionately
styled, ”The Patriarch“ among us.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘He believed in his work, rejoiced in it, was proud
of it. To him are all insurance journalists debtors for
the high standard of life and labor which he set and by
his conduct exemplified.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘Called hence in his yet unwithered ripeness of
mind and heart, he leaves us the pleasant and heartening
memory of one who honored our profession by
staunch though tolerant fidelity to his sense of right.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘Committee.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Life Underwriters’ Association of New York,
at a meeting held last night, appointed a committee
which drew up the following minute:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘The members of this association are profoundly
grieved in learning that their brother and friend,
Charles C. Hine, has passed out of the mortal into the
immortal life, and that they are to see his face no
more. He was known to life insurance workers
around the world. For a third of a century his was
<a id='Page_276'></a>a helping hand to every toiler in the life insurance
field. His journalistic work was not perfunctory,
but glad and joyous. He believed.
He had strong convictions. And he lived to
see the little rill of life insurance broaden and
deepen into the mighty river. As a writer he was
many-sided. He knew the tensile strength of fact as
expressed in figures and diagrams; and his work was
enhanced in value by a never-ceasing play of humor.
As a speaker none who ever heard him will forget
him. He was ready, convincing, entertaining, versatile,
apt. Living two years beyond his allotted three-score
and ten, he seemed in appearance but to have
entered upon the Indian Summer of his days. When
last with us, but a few weeks since, he appeared to be
but little changed from what he was a score of years
ago. When the end came he was as a ”shock of corn
fully ripe“, ready to be garnered. It was meet and fit
that he should go thus swiftly, with the light shining
on him from the worlds out of sight, for he had lived
his life with such a transfer in view. This association
holds out its hand in silence to the sorrowing ones of
his household, for whose deeper grief it has the profoundest
sympathy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Committee.’—[Insurance Record—April.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was a good morning for taking a last look. The
sun shone forth in cloudless beauty, the air was
sweeter for a frost of the night before; there was
<a id='Page_277'></a>green grass, and much token, too, of leafage and
flower. This is the time of year when the outer world
tries hard to tell us of something better than itself.
Not a violet or a dandelion by the wayside that does
not sing of bloom that shall never fade. A seeming
endless repetition of life and death points true to the
endless life, the spring time unfading, the friendships
that endure.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The simple ceremonies were held at the little
church where the man was best known. There were
banks of flowers, and there were streaming eyes. He
must have been dear to the children for many of them
were weeping as though they had lost a father. The
place was crowded. The minister told a simple story
of what the life had been on its religious side. Mr.
Hine was an earnest Christian worker. He was a
helper of others. He had no debate over doctrines.
He accepted the truths of Christianity, and practiced
what he believed. He was a helper of the poor, of the
widow and the fatherless. It was a most pathetic address,
out of the heart of a man who felt that the community
has suffered an irreparable loss.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thus did we get a glimpse of the real life of the
man, and take note of the things he lived for. Many,
many years we knew him here in the great, babbling
town. Like the rest of us, he had his work to do, and
he did it with a will. But his heart the while was
there in the little church, there with the pastor, the
poor, the children.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is a benefaction to be buried when life is bursting
<a id='Page_278'></a>forth everywhere. The autumn entombment is
followed by a cold and dreary winter. It is so hard for
those who weep to listen to the sleet against the window,
the madness of the storm. And the snow piled
up on the fresh tomb, how it chills one to think of it!
But now come sunshiny days and calm, sweet nights,
and through all the shining stars talk to us, and tell
us that our dead were never buried, but journeyed
swiftly to worlds more glorious; and we believe what
they say. But we hear not the star voices except when
there are calm and warmth, and bud and blossom.”—[Charles
D. Lakey, in Insurance.</p>

<p class='c004'>“C. C. Hine was a stalwart figure in whatever walk
of life he appeared. His character was sturdy and
substantial in its development. Born in New Haven,
Conn., in 1825, he early went to the then Far West to
try his fortune, and in those rigorous times he laid the
foundations for a sound physical and mental manhood.
He was successively school teacher, artist, leader in
telegraphy, insurance agent and insurance officer. In
1868 he purchased the ‘Insurance Monitor’, the oldest
American insurance journal now in existence, and had,
therefore, conducted it, as editor and proprietor, for
upwards of thirty years. As a writer his style was
original, vigorous and entertaining. He had strong
opinions and never hesitated to express them. Especially
in fire insurance he left his impress upon the
thought and practice of the time. He had a peculiar
facility in verbal expression, and was often called upon
<a id='Page_279'></a>to speak in public upon insurance subjects, his addresses
being always acceptable.”—[Insurance Age.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And so our old friend and ever courteous contemporary,
Charles C. Hine, has gone over to the
great majority. Although his stay here was longer in
years than is the measure of time allotted earthly
visitors, his departure is none the less sorrowful to all
of us who knew and loved him well for his exemplary
characteristics. As editor of the Monitor, and as a
comrade in a special field of journalism, we were
proud of the cordial relationship that existed without
friction or interruption for more than a score of years
between C. C. Hine and us. ‘To him’—as Editor
Davis well said in the minute adopted at the meeting
of insurance journalists—‘are all insurance journalists
debtors for the high standard of life and labor which
he set and by his conduct exemplified’. But, as
Brother Lakey graphically expressed it, in the resolution
he prepared for, and which was adopted by, the
Life Underwriters’ Association: ‘When the end came
he (C. C. Hine) was as a ”shock of corn fully ripe“,
ready to be garnered. It was meet and fit that he
should go thus swiftly with the light shining on him
from worlds out of sight, for he had lived his life with
such a transfer in view.’ In adding a word of tribute
to the fragrant memory of this good man may we not
confidently voice the hope, as we say farewell to him,
that peace and joy shall be his share for evermore?”—[Vigilant.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_280'></a>“Personally, Mr. Hine was a most agreeable companion,
well informed on a wide range of subjects, an
easy and interesting talker, always ready with a good
story and, what is somewhat rare among story tellers,
as willing to listen as to tell. Everybody liked him,
and he had the good word of the people where he had
lived. The writer of this well remembers some twenty
years ago being down at Peru, Ill., on a case before
Squire Underhill, a Justice of the Peace. The trial
had drawn together quite a lot of old citizens, and
while waiting for a witness a general conversation was
indulged in. The writer happening to mention that
he had just got back from New York, and insurance
being referred to in connection with the visit, the
’Squire’s face lit up and he said: ‘New York—why,
that’s where Charley Hine lives; runs an insurance
paper down there. Do you know Charley?’ The question
being answered satisfactorily, one and another of
the old citizens began to tell about when Charley Hine
set up the telegraph in Peru along back in 1850, or
thereabouts, and what a smart young fellow he was,
and so pleasant and accommodating, too. We have
no doubt that his acquaintance with Charley Hine
helped the learned counsel to win his case, which was
not an especially good one.”—[Insurance.</p>

<h4 class='c008'>THE PATRIARCH RAISES HIS VOICE IN SONG.</h4>
<p class='c006'>“I thought I knew the Patriarch fairly well, and
that I was ‘on’ to all of his varied accomplishments.
I knew that he could get upon his feet before an assembly
and make an interesting talk, but I never
knew until recently that he was a singer! I read in
a report of the last meeting of the Fire Underwriters’
Association of the Northwest that ‘Father Hine was
then introduced, and after a few jokes sang a song
which evoked continuous laughter’. There is something
droll in the idea of it to me, but I would bet another
(dinner) with whosoever would take me up that
Mr. Hine acquitted himself with his usual completeness.
He can do a good many things, and i’ faith he
can do ’em all well. He would not undertake anything
he could not.”—[Insurance World, November, 1896.</p>
<h4 class='c008'>AFTER THE BANQUET WAS OVER.</h4>
<p class='c006'>“In his October Monitor, C. C. Hine modestly refers
to ‘a little occurrence’ that followed the recent
banquet of the Northwestern Association. The ‘little
occurrence’ was a one-minute speech made by Mr.
<a id='Page_282'></a>Hine himself, in the presence of a company of fifteen,
in response to a very complimentary toast proposed
by H. C. Eddy of this city (Chicago). As near as we
can recall it, this is what the Patriarch said: Gentlemen,
I am nearly three score and ten years old. It is
getting to be half-past eleven with me, and the longer
I live and the older I grow the more I appreciate the
friendships I have made and the more I appreciate
such friendly expressions as this.’ Then, taking up
his glass, he added, ‘I became a teetotaler at the age
of twelve, and must therefore drink with you in cold
water.’ The Patriarch said this from his heart, and
the late hour and the deserted banquet hall added to
the impressiveness of his remarks. But was he quite
sure as to his own age? His eye is as bright and his
voice as clear and ringing as when first we knew him,
and his form is as erect and upright as his life has
been. We repeated Mr. Hine’s little speech to two
grandmothers that we know, and they repeated it to
‘the boy’, and the grandmothers told the boy that they
hoped so good a temperance advocate would live a
thousand years. ‘So say we all of us’—God save the
Patriarch!”—[Insurance Post, October, 1894.</p>

city. That here, when a local agent, he distributed
blotting pads and cultivated the art of soliciting,
which has served him many a good turn in later years.
Here the foundation was laid for the broader work
which fate had in store for him. The bright, young
Hoosier, full of wit and good humor, was to become
the grave and thoughtful ‘Patriarch’, honored and beloved
as a leader in his chosen profession.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is a ‘touch of nature’ in us all, which inspires
a curiosity to know something of those who
have succeeded in life—who have become distinguished.
That a great humorist should have wept at
the tomb of Adam was to me no joke, provided that
the spot selected was the genuine burial place of that
eminent citizen. Who would not like to walk in the
garden where Plato conversed, or view the forum
from which Cicero spoke? To visit Avon and spend
a day where Shakespeare sleeps will always be indeed
a pleasure. Who, that is thoughtful, goes to Springfield,
or Galena, without seeing the modest houses
where Lincoln and Grant lived, when unhonored and
unknown.</p>

<p class='c004'>“With this feeling, I sought and found the little,
old-fashioned brick building, where, a third of a century
ago, was the insurance office of Mr. Hine. On
the side of the hill, a few blocks away, was the unassuming
dwelling house, where the young agent lived
<a id='Page_284'></a>in comfort and dignity, surrounded by a most loving
family, and respected and esteemed by neighbors,
many of whom have themselves since become known
throughout the United States as wise statesmen,
brave soldiers and honorable business men.</p>

<p class='c004'>“While in New Albany I was told many anecdotes
illustrating Mr. Hine’s goodness of heart, fondness
for children and devotion to charitable and Christian
work. These cannot be repeated at this time. The
following, however, told me by an old citizen, illustrates
a type of manhood that, I fear, is becoming
rarer each year, and is in danger of becoming, in time,
entirely extinct:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“About 1853 the McCormick family offered the
New Albany Theological Seminary $100,000 if that
institution should be removed to Chicago. The offer
was accepted, and Mr. Hine purchased the property
which was vacated, and spent all the money he had,
and all he could borrow, in erecting and fitting up
buildings for a female college. The institution was
thoroughly advertised, had the sympathy of the best
people in the Southwest, and was about being opened
under the most favorable auspices, when the financial
crisis of 1857 swept over the West, cruelly prostrating
and crushing thousands of the best and most public-spirited
men in the country. Mr. Hine went down
with the rest, losing every dollar he had, and being
many thousand dollars in debt. He was broken up—badly
broken up—but, fortunately, not broken down,
for there is all the difference imaginable between the
<a id='Page_285'></a>two. Mr. Hine then returned to the insurance business,
traveling awhile for the Ætna Insurance Company,
then becoming secretary of the International
Insurance Company, subsequently, on the decease of
the famous Tom Jones, purchasing the Insurance
Monitor, at the head of which he has remained until
the present time.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What became of his debts? Did he forget his
creditors when he subsequently became prosperous,
as so many others do? These were the questions I
asked. Were the circumstances of his failure such as
reflected unfavorably on his integrity and honesty?
Did he afterward make settlements with his creditors
that were satisfactory? Let others answer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“1. Gen. B. F. Scribner a well-known citizen of
Indiana, and a resident of New Albany, said to me:
‘Mr. Hine’s failure was an honest one, and in no way
reflected unfavorably on his honesty and integrity.
He subsequently made settlements with his creditors
that were entirely satisfactory. His conduct all
through his troubles was such as to command the respect
and sympathy of all right-minded citizens. The
brevity of this statement very feebly expresses my admiration
for Mr. Hine’s conduct and character.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“2. John C. Culbertson, Esq., formerly of New
Albany, but now an honored resident of Santa Barbara,
Cal., said: ‘Mr. Hine has been my intimate
friend for over thirty years. He failed in New Albany
years ago. Borrowed money to pay his servants.
The Ætna Insurance Company advanced him $100 to
<a id='Page_286'></a>support his little family in this trying time. Since
then he has prospered, and has hunted up his creditors
and paid them all in full, with interest, in some instances
more than two dollars for one. He is an upright,
Christian gentleman.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“3. L. G. Mathews, Esq., vice-president of the
Ohio Falls Car Company, said: ‘Mr. Hine’s failure
was due solely to the depressed condition of the times,
financially. I was one of his creditors, and never
knew of any one who complained of his honesty or
want of integrity. As fast as he recovered from his
misfortunes, and could spare the money, he devoted
it to paying his debts. His manner of doing it was
characteristic. He picked out the poorest and neediest
of his creditors and paid them first. As an incident, I
failed in business in 1872. Mr. Hine heard of it and
sent me his check for principal and interest in full. I
doubt if there is a man living, who, having left New
Albany, could return and receive such a cordial welcome
from all who knew him.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“4. Walter Mann, Esq., formerly a banker at New
Albany, and now a resident of Minneapolis, said:
‘Mr. Hine left New Albany largely in debt and with
nothing to begin the world again with, except experience
and the best wishes of his friends. He afterward
paid his debts, principal and interest. I was one of
his creditors and speak whereof I know. His failure
was an honest one and his conduct characterized by
the highest integrity and honor. He paid his debts
after he had ceased to be under any obligations to do
<a id='Page_287'></a>so, and his record shows his thorough old-fashioned
honesty and entire devotion to what he regards his
duty.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“This article is written without the knowledge of
Mr. Hine, and purely as a labor of love. In common
with thousands of other underwriters I am indebted
to the editor of the Monitor in a way that can never
be paid with money.”</p>
